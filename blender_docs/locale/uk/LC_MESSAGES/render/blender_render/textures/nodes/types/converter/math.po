"This example has a *Time* node putting out a linear sequence from 0 to 1 "

"the sine function can put out values between (-1.0 to 1.0), the *Map "

"adding 1 (making 0 to 2), and multiplying the result by one-half (thus "

"To accomplish this quantization of an image to 256 possible values, let "
"us use the set {6, 6, 7}. To split up a continuous range of values "
"between 0 and 1 (the full Red spectrum) into six values, we need to "

"puts out six possible values, as illustrated by the image to the right. "
"We want to include zero as true black, with five other colors in between."
" The approach shown produces {0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1}. Dividing 1.0 by "

"The theory behind this function is scaled truncation. Suppose we want a "
"math function that takes in a range of values between 0 and 1, such as "
"0.552, but only outputs a value of 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, etc. We can imagine "
"then that we need to get that range 0 to 1 powered up to something 0 to 6"
" so that we can chop off and make it a whole number. So, with six "
"divisions, how can we do that? The answer is we multiply the range by 6. "
"The output of that first math Multiply Node is a range of values between "
"0 and 6. To get even divisions, because we are using the rounding "
"function (see documentation above), we want any number plus or minus "
"around a whole number will get rounded to that number. So, we subtract a "
"half, which shifts everything over. The round() function then makes that "
"range 0 to 5. We then divide by 5 to get back a range of numbers between "
"0 and 1 which can then be combined back with the other color channels. "
"Thus, you get the function :math:`f(x, n) = round(x × n - 0.5)/ (n - 1)` "
"where \"n\" is the number of possible output values, and \"x\" is the "
"input pixel color and :math:`f(x, n)` is the output value. There is only "
"one slight problem, and that is for the value exactly equal to 1, the "
"formula result is 1.2, which is an invalid value. This is because the "
"round function is actually a roundup function, and exactly 5.5 is rounded"
" up to 6. So, by subtracting 0.501, we compensate and thus 5. 499 is "
"rounded to 5. At the other end of the spectrum, pure black, or 0, when "
"0.501 subtracted, rounds up to 0 since the Round() function does not "
"return a negative number."

"Sometimes using a spreadsheet can help you figure out how to put these "
"nodes together to get the result that you want. Stepping you through the "
"formula for :math:`n = 6` and :math:`x = 0.70`, locate the line on the "
"spreadsheet that has the 8-bit value 179 and R value 0.7. Multiplying by "
"6 gives 4.2. Subtracting 1/2 gives 3.7, which rounds up to 4.4 divided by"
" 5 = 0.8. Thus, f(0.7, 6) = 0.8 or an 8-bit value of 204. You can see "
"that this same 8-bit value is output for a range of input values."

"To implement this function in Blender, consider the node setup above. "
"First, feed the image to the Separate RGB node. For the Red channel, we "
"string the math nodes into a function that takes each red color, "
"multiplies (scales) it up by the desired number of divisions (6), offsets"
" it by 0.5, rounds the value to the nearest whole number, and then "
"divides the image pixel color by 5. So, the transformation is {0 to 1} "
"becomes {0 to 6}, subtracting centers the medians to {-0.5 to 5.5} and "
"the rounding to the nearest whole number produces {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} "
