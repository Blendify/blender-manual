"*Game Logic* is the default scripting layer in the Game Engine. Each "
"*Game Object* in the game may store a collection of logical components "
"(Logic Bricks) which control its behavior within the scene. Logic bricks "
"can be combined to perform user-defined actions that determine the "
"progression of the simulation."

"The main part of game logic can be set up through a graphical interface "
"the :doc:`Logic Editor </editors/logic_editor>`, and therefore does not "
"require detailed programming knowledge. Logic is set up as blocks (or "
"\"bricks\") which represent preprogrammed functions; these can be tweaked"
" and combined to create the game/application. There are three types of "
"logic brick: :doc:`Sensors </game_engine/logic/sensors/introduction>`, "
":doc:`Controllers </game_engine/logic/controllers/introduction>` and "
":doc:`Actuators </game_engine/logic/actuators/introduction>`. Sensors are"
" primitive event listeners, which are triggered by specific events, such "
"as a collision, a key press or mouse movement. Controllers carry out "
"logic operations on sensor output, and trigger connected actuators when "
"their operating conditions are met. Actuators interact with the "
"simulation directly, and are the only components in the game which are "
"able to do so (other than the Python controller, and other simulation "
"components such as Physics)."

":doc:`Properties </game_engine/logic/properties>` are like variables in "
"other programming languages. They are used to save and access data values"
" either for the whole game (e.g. scores), or for particular "
"objects/players (e.g. names). However, in the Blender Game Engine, a "
"property is associated with an object. Properties can be of different "
"types, and are set up in a special area of the :doc:`Logic Editor "
"</editors/logic_editor>`."

"Another useful feature is object :doc:`States "
"</game_engine/logic/states>`. At any time while the simulation is "
"running, the object will process any logic which belongs to the current "
"state of the object. States can be used to define groups of behavior -- "
"e.g. an actor object may be \"sleeping\", \"awake\" or \"dead\", and its "
"logic behavior may be different in each of these three states. The states"
" of an object are set up, displayed and edited in the Controller logic "
"bricks for the object."
