"Constraints are a way to control an object's properties (e.g. its "
"location, rotation, scale), using either plain static values (like the "
":doc:`\"limit\" ones </rigging/constraints/transform/limit_location>`), "
"or another object, called \"target\" (like e.g. the :doc:`\"copy\" ones "
"</rigging/constraints/transform/copy_location>`)."

"Even though constraints are useful in static projects, their main usage "
"is obviously in animation."

"You can control an object's animation through the targets used by its "
"constraints (this is a form of indirect animation). Indeed, these targets"
" can then control the constraint's owner's properties, and hence, "
"animating the targets will indirectly animate the owner."

"You can animate constraints' settings. e.g. the *Influence* or when using"
" an armature's bone as target, animate where along this bone (between "
"root and tip) lays the real target point."

"They can make the eyes of a tennis player track a tennis ball bouncing "
"across the court, allow the wheels on a bus to all rotate together, help "
"a dinosaur's legs bend at the knee automatically, and make it easy for a "
"hand to grip the hilt of a sword and the sword to swing with the hand."

"Start simply. Get to know a single constraint inside and out. "
":doc:`/rigging/constraints/transform/copy_location` is a good first "
"constraint to explore it also has an animation example. Take the time to "
"understand every fundamental concept behind it, and the other constraints"
" will make far more sense."
