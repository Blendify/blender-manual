"When you have unwrapped, possibly using seams, your UV layout may be "
"quite disorganized and chaotic. You may need to proceed with the "
"following tasks: Orientation of the UV mapping, arranging the UV maps, "
"stitching several maps together."

msgid ""
"The next step is to work with the UV layouts that you have created "
"through the unwrap process. If you do add faces or subdivide existing "
"faces when a model is already unwrapped, Blender will add those new faces"
" for you. In this fashion, you can use the UV texture image to guide "
"additional geometry changes."

"When arranging, keep in mind that the entire view is your workspace, but "
"only the UV coordinates within the grid are mapped to the image. So, you "
"can put pieces off to the side while you arrange them. Also, each UV "
"unwrap is its own linked set of coordinates."

"You can lay them on top of one another, and they will onionskin (the "
"bottom one will show through the top one). To grab only one though, "
":kbd:`RMB` select one of the UV coordinates, and use "
":menuselection:`Select --> Linked UVs`, :kbd:`Ctrl-L` to select connected"
" UVs, not border select because UVs from both will be selected."

msgid ""
"Very often you will unwrap an object, such as the face example we have "
"been using, and get it \"mostly right\" but with parts of the mesh that "
"did not unwrap properly, or are horribly confusing. The picture to the "
"right shows an initial unwrap of the face using the Unwrap from sphere "
"option. The issues are with the ear; it is just a mush of UVs, and the "
"neck, it is stretched and folded under. Too much work to clean up."

msgid "Unwrap face only, without ear or neck."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/editors/uv_image/uv/editing/layout_workflow.rst:47
msgid ""
"We can tell that the ear would unwrap nicely with just a straightforward "
"projection from the side view, and the neck with a tubular unwrap. So, "
"our general approach will be to unwrap different parts of the object "
"(face, ears, and so on) using different unwrap calculations, selecting "
"each calculation according to whatever works best for that piece. So let "
"us begin: We select only the \"face\" faces, unwrap them using the "
"*Sphere* calculation, and scale and rotate them somewhat to fit logically"
" within the image area of the UV/Image Editor."

msgid ""
"Once we are satisfied with the face, it is time to turn our attention to "
"the ear. First, unselect the faces you were working with. Their UVs will "
"disappear from the UV/Image Editor, but they are still there, just not "
"shown. (To verify this, you can select a few faces in 3D View and it will"
" show up in the UV/Image Editor)."

msgid ""
"To work on the ear, in the 3D View, we now select only the \"ear\" faces."
" You can use Vertex Groups to select the ear faces. Selecting sub-meshes "
"is easy too, since they are not connected to the rest of the mesh. Simply"
" selecting Linked vertices will select that entire submesh. Basically, "
"since you are in Edit Mode, all of the selecting/deselecting features are"
" available to you."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now re-unwrap the ear using the *Project* calculation from side view, and"
" scale and rotate them somewhat (discussed in the next section), and "
"place them off to the side. You can do this repetitively, using different"
" UV calculations; each re-calculation just puts those UVs for the "
"selected faces somewhere else. Choose the calculation for each piece that"
" gives you the best fit and most logical layout for subsequent painting "
"of that piece."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/editors/uv_image/uv/editing/layout_workflow.rst:76
msgid ""
"When all of the pieces of the mesh have been unwrapped using the various "
"calculations, you should end up with something that looks like to the "
"Example to the right. All of the sections of the mesh have been mapped, "
"and all those maps are laid out in the same UV texture map. "
"Congratulations! From here, it is a simple matter of \"stitching\" "
"(discussed in the next section) to construct the entire UV map as a "
"single map."

msgid ""
"When you have completed arranging and stitching, you will end up with a "
"consolidated UV map, like that shown to the right, arranged such that a "
"single image will cover, or paint, all of the mesh that needs detailed "
"painting. All of the detailed instructions on how to do this are "
"contained in the next section. The point of this paragraph is to show you"
" the ultimate goal. Note that the mesh shown is Mirrored along the Z "
"axis, so the right side of the face is virtual; it is an exact copy of "
"the right, so only one set of UVs actually exist. (If more realism is "
"desired, the Mirror Modifier would be applied, resulting in a physical "
"mirror and a complete head. You could then make both side physically "
"different by editing one side and not the other. Unwrapping would produce"
" a full set of UVs (for each side) and painting could thus be different "
"for each side of the face, which is more realistic)."

msgid ""
"At least for common people, we just do not \"get it right the first "
"time.\" It takes building on an idea and iterating our creative process "
"until we reach that magical milestone called \"Done.\" In software "
"development, this is called the Spiral Methodology."

"Applied to Computer Graphics, we cycle between modeling, texturing, "
"animating, and then back to making some modifications to mesh, re-UV "
"mapping, tweaking the animation, adding a bone or two, finding out we "
"need a few more faces, so back to modeling, etc. We continue going round "
"and round like this until we either run out of time, money, or patience, "
"or, in some rare cases, are actually happy with our results."

msgid ""
"Refinement comes into play when we finally look at our character, and "
"realize that we need more detail in a particular spot. For example, areas"
" around the eyes might need crow's feet, or we need to add a logo to the "
"vest. As you start to edit the image, you realize that there just are not"
" enough pixels available to paint the detail that you want."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/editors/uv_image/uv/editing/layout_workflow.rst:124
msgid ""
"Your only choice is to expand the size (scale out) that UV face. Using "
"the Minimize stretch or Scale tools, you expand the UV faces around the "
"eyes or chest, allocating more pixels to those areas, but at the same "
"time taking away pixels (detail) from something else, like the back of "
"the head. After refining the UV map, you then edit the image so that it "
"looks right and contains the details you want."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Another consideration is the need to conserve resources. Each image file "
"is loaded in memory. If you can reuse the same image on different meshes,"
" it saves memory. So, for example, you might want to have a generic face "
"painting, and use that on different characters, but alter the UV map and "
"shape and props (sunglasses) to differentiate."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/editors/uv_image/uv/editing/layout_workflow.rst:140
msgid ""
"You might want to have a \"faded blue jeans\" texture, and unwrap just "
"the legs of characters to use that image. It would be good to have a "
"generic skin image, and use that for character's hands, feet, arms, legs,"
" and neck. When modeling a fantasy sword, a small image for a piece of "
"the sword blade would suffice, and you would Reset Unwrap the sword faces"
" to reuse that image down the length of the blade."
