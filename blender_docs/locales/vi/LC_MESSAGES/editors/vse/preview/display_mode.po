"The display plots for every scanline the luminance value. The lines are "

"same."

"In this mode, the vertical axis represents the luminosity: 0 at the "

"horizontal axis of the frame. There are as many curves as scanlines in "
"the frame: each one of this curves represents the luminosity of the "
"pixels of one line. Moreover, the color of a pixel in this mode "
"represents the number of pixels from the matching column of the frame "
"sharing the same luminosity, i.e. the number of curves that cross at this"
