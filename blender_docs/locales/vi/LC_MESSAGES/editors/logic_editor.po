"The Logic Editor provides the main method of setting up and editing the "
"game logic for the various actors (i.e. objects) that make up the game. "
"The logic for the objects which are currently selected in the associated "
"3D View are displayed as logic bricks, which are shown as a table with "
"three columns, showing sensors, controllers, and actuators, respectively."
" The links joining the logic bricks conduct the pulses between sensor-"
"controller and controller-actuator."

"Links (3A) indicate the direction of logical flow between objects. Link "

"Controllers to Actuators. You cannot directly link Sensors to Actuators; "
"likewise, Actuators cannot be linked back to Sensors (however, special "
