"Baking also provides improved foam capabilities. When simulating live, "
"the ocean simulator retrieves data for that current frame only. In the "
"case of the foam map, this represents the tips of wave crests for that "
"given frame. In reality, after foam is created by wave interactions, it "
"remains sitting on the top of the wave surface for a while, as it "
"dissipates. With baking, it is possible to approximate that behavior, by "
"accumulating foam from previous frames, leaving it remaining on the "

"The simulator itself uses FFT methods to generate 2D grids of simulation "
"information internally, very similar to 2D texture maps. The simulator "
"can generate three types of data: displacement, normals, and extra data, "

"simulation, these maps are used to displace the ocean surface geometry in"
