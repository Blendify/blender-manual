"Ambient Occlusion is a sophisticated ray-tracing calculation which "
"simulates soft global illumination shadows by faking darkness perceived "
"in corners and at mesh intersections, creases, and cracks, where ambient "
"light is occluded, or blocked."

"There is no such thing as AO in the real world; AO is a specific not-"
"physically-accurate (but generally nice-looking) rendering trick. It "
"basically samples a hemisphere around each point on the face, sees what "
"proportion of that hemisphere is occluded by other geometry, and shades "
"the pixel accordingly."

"It is got nothing to do with light at all; it is purely a rendering trick"
" that tends to look nice because generally in real-world surfaces that "
"are close together (like small cracks) will be darker than surfaces that "
"do not have anything in front of them, because of shadows, dirt, etc."
msgstr ""

"The AO process, though, approximates this result; it is not simulating "
"light bouncing around or going through things. That is why AO still works"
" when you do not have any lights in the scene, and it is why just "
"switching on AO alone is a very bad way of \"lighting\" a scene."
