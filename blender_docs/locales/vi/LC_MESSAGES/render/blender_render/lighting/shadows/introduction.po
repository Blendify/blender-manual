"Light would not even exist without its counterpart: shadows. Shadows are "
"a darkening of a portion of an object because light is being partially or"
" totally blocked from illuminating the object. They add contrast and "
"volume to a scene; there is nearly no place in the real world without "
"shadows, so to get realistic renders, you will need them. Blender "
"supports the following kinds of shadows:"

"Ambient occlusion really is not a shadow based on light *per se*, but "
"based on geometry. However, it does mimic an effect where light is "
"prevented from fully and uniformly illuminating an object, so it is "
"mentioned here. Also, it is important to mention ambient lighting, since "
"increasing *Ambient* decreases the effect of a shadow."

"You can use a combination of ray-traced and buffer shadows to achieve "
"different results. Even within ray-traced shadows, different lamps cast "
"different patterns and intensities of shadow. Depending on how you "
"arrange your lamps, one lamp may wipe out or override the shadow cast by "
"another lamp."

"For example, the simple *Lamp*, *Area*, and *Sun* light has the ability "

"both, whereas the *Hemi* light does not cast any. If a *Sun* lamp is "
"pointing sideways, it will not cast a shadow from a sphere above a plane "

"As opposed to buffered shadows (`Lamps: Buffered Shadows`_), ray-traced "
"shadows are obtained by casting rays from a regular light source, "
"uniformly and in all directions. The ray tracer then records which pixel "
"of the final image is hit by a ray light, and which is not. Those that "
"are not are obviously obscured by a shadow."

"Each light casts rays in a different way. For example, a *Spot* light "

"*Buffered* shadows provide fast-rendered shadows at the expense of "

"For a scanline renderer -- and Blender's built-in engine *is*, among "

"image -- for each point from the spot light is saved. Any point in the "
"\"rendered\" image that is farther away than any of those points in the "
