Editing Bones

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Edit Mode
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`Tab`


You will learn here how to add (`Adding Bones`_),
delete (`Deleting Bones`_) or subdivide (`Subdividing Bones`_) bones.
We will also see how to prevent any bone transformation (`Locking Bones`_) in *Edit Mode*,
and the option that features an automatic mirroring (`X-Axis Mirror Editing`_) of editing actions along the X axis.


Adding Bones
============

To add bones to your armature, you have more or less the same options as when editing meshes:

- *Add* menu,
- extrusion,
- :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` clicks,
- fill between joints,
- duplication.


Add Menu
--------

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Edit Mode
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`Shift-A`


In the 3D View, :kbd:`Shift-A` :menuselection:`--> Bone` to add a new bone to your armature.

This bone will be:

- of one Blender Unit of length,
- oriented towards the positive Y axis of the view,
- with its root placed at the 3D cursor position,
- with no relationship with any other bone of the armature.


Extrusion
---------

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Edit Mode
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Armature --> Extrude`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`E`, :kbd:`Shift-E`


When you press :kbd:`E`, for each selected tip
(either explicitly or implicitly), a new bone is created.
This bone will be the child of "its" tip owner, and connected to it. As usual,
once extrusion is done, only the new bones' tips are selected, and in grab mode,
so you can place them to your liking. See Fig. :ref:`fig-rig-bones-extrusion`.

.. _fig-rig-bones-extrusion:

.. list-table:: Extrusion example.

   * - .. figure:: /images/rigging_armatures_editing_bones_extrusion-1.png
          :width: 320px

          An armature with three selected tips.

     - .. figure:: /images/rigging_armatures_editing_bones_extrusion-2.png
          :width: 320px

          The three extruded bones.


You also can use the rotating/scaling extrusions,
as with meshes, by pressing respectively :kbd:`E-R` and :kbd:`E-S` --
as well as :doc:`locked </editors/3dview/object/transform/transform_control/precision/axis_locking>`
extrusion along a global or local axis.

.. _fig-rig-bone-mirror:

.. list-table:: Mirror extrusion example.

   * - .. figure:: /images/rigging_armatures_editing_bones_mirror-extrusion-1.png
          :width: 320px

          A single selected bone's tip.

     - .. figure:: /images/rigging_armatures_editing_bones_mirror-extrusion-2.png
          :width: 320px

          The two mirror-extruded bones.


Bones have an extra "mirror extruding" tool, called by pressing :kbd:`Shift-E`.
By default, it behaves exactly like the standard extrusion.
But once you have enabled the X-Axis mirror editing option
(see `X-Axis Mirror Editing`_),
each extruded tip will produce *two new bones*, having the same name except for the "_L"/ "_R" suffix
(for left/right, see the :ref:`next page <armature-editing-naming-conventions>`).
The "_L" bone behaves like the single one produced by the default extrusion --
you can grab/rotate/scale it exactly the same way.
The "_R" bone is its mirror counterpart (along the armature's local X axis), see Fig. :ref:`fig-rig-bone-mirror`.

.. warning::

   Canceling the extrude action causes the newly created bones to snap back to the source position,
   (creating zero length bones). These will be removed when exiting Edit Mode,
   however, they can cause confusion and it's unlikely you want to keep them.
   If you realize the problem immediately undo the extrude action.


In case you are wondering, you cannot just press :kbd:`X` to solve this as you would in mesh editing,
because extrusion selects the newly created tips, and as explained below the delete command ignores bones' joints.
To get rid of these extruded bones without undoing, you would have to move the tips,
then select the bones and delete (`Deleting Bones`_) them.


Mouse Clicks
------------

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Edit Mode
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB`


If at least one bone is selected, :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` -clicking adds a new bone.

About the new bone's tip:

- after you :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` -clicked it becomes the active element in the armature,
- it appears to be right where you clicked, but...
- ...(as in mesh editing) it will be on the plane parallel to the view and passing through the 3D cursor.

The position of the root and the parenting of the new bone depends on the active element:

.. figure:: /images/rigging_armatures_editing_bones_mouse-clicks-1.png
   :width: 300px

   Ctrl-clicking when the active element is a bone.


If the active element is a *bone*

- the new bone's root is placed on the active bone's tip
- the new bone is parented and connected to the active bone
  (check the Outliner in Fig. :ref:`fig-rig-bone-active-tip`).

.. _fig-rig-bone-active-tip:

.. figure:: /images/rigging_armatures_editing_bones_mouse-clicks-2.png
   :width: 300px

   Ctrl-clicking when the active element is a tip.


If the active element is a *tip* :

- the new bone's root is placed on the active tip
- the new bone is parented and connected to the bone owning the active tip
  (check the Outliner in Fig. :ref:`fig-rig-bone-active-tip`).

.. _fig-rig-bone-disconnected-tip:

.. figure:: /images/rigging_armatures_editing_bones_mouse-clicks-3.png
   :width: 300px

   Ctrl-clicking when the active element is a disconnected root.


If the active element is a *disconnected root* :

- the new bone's root is placed on the active root
- the new bone is **not** parented to the bone owning the active root
  (check the Outliner in Fig. :ref:`fig-rig-bone-disconnected-tip`).

And hence the new bone will **not** be connected to any bone.

.. _fig-rig-bone-connected-root:

.. figure:: /images/rigging_armatures_editing_bones_mouse-clicks-4.png
   :width: 300px

   Ctrl-clicking when the active element is a connected root.


If the active element is a *connected root* :

- the new bone's root is placed on the active root
- the new bone **is** parented and connected to the parent of the bone owning the active root
  (check the Outliner in Fig. :ref:`fig-rig-bone-connected-root`).

This should be obvious because if the active element is a connected root then the active
element is also the tip of the parent bone, so it is the same as the second case.


As the tip of the new bone becomes the active element,
you can repeat these :kbd:`Ctrl-RMB` several times,
to consecutively add several bones to the end of the same chain.


Fill between joints
-------------------

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Edit Mode
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Armature --> Fill Between Joints`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`F`


The main use of this tool is to create one bone between two selected joints by pressing
:kbd:`F`, similar to how in mesh editing you can "create edges/faces".

If you have one root and one tip selected, the new bone:

- Will have the root placed on the selected tip.
- Will have the tip placed on the selected root.
- Will be parented and connected to the bone owning the selected tip.

.. list-table:: Fill between a tip and a root.

   * - .. figure:: /images/rigging_armatures_editing_bones_fill-joints-1.png
          :width: 320px

          Active tip on the left.

     - .. figure:: /images/rigging_armatures_editing_bones_fill-joints-2.png
          :width: 320px

          Active tip on the right.


If you have two tips selected, the new bone:

- Will have the root placed on the selected tip closest to the 3D cursor.
- Will have the tip placed on the other selected tip.
- Will be parented and connected to the bone owning the tip used as the new bone's root.

.. list-table:: Fill between tips.

   * - .. figure:: /images/rigging_armatures_editing_bones_fill-joints-3.png
          :width: 320px

          3D cursor on the left.

     - .. figure:: /images/rigging_armatures_editing_bones_fill-joints-4.png
          :width: 320px

          3D cursor on the right.


If you have two roots selected, you will face a small problem due to the event system in
Blender not updating the interface in real time.

When clicking :kbd:`F`, similar to the previous case, you will see a new bone:

- With the root placed on the selected root closest to the 3D cursor.
- With the tip placed on the other selected root.
- Parented and connected to the bone owning the root used as the new bone's root.

If you try to move the new bone, Blender will update the interface and you will see that the
new bone's root moves to the tip of the parent bone.

.. list-table:: Fill between roots.

   * - .. figure:: /images/rigging_armatures_editing_bones_fill-joints-5.png
          :width: 320px

          Before UI update (3D cursor on the left).

     - .. figure:: /images/rigging_armatures_editing_bones_fill-joints-6.png
          :width: 320px

          After UI update, correct visualization.


Clicking :kbd:`F` with only one bone joint selected will create a bone from the selected
joint to the 3D cursor position, and it will not parent it to any bone in the armature.

.. list-table:: Fill with only one bone joint selected.

   * - .. figure:: /images/rigging_armatures_editing_bones_fill-joints-7.png
          :width: 320px

          Fill with only one tip selected.

     - .. figure:: /images/rigging_armatures_editing_bones_fill-joints-8.png
          :width: 320px

          Fill with only one root selected.


You will get an error when:

- trying to fill two joints of the same bone, or
- trying to fill more than two bone joints.


Duplication
-----------

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Edit Mode
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Armature --> Duplicate`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`Shift-D`

.. note::

   This tool works on selected bones; selected joints are ignored.


As in mesh editing, by pressing :kbd:`Shift-D`:

- the selected bones will be duplicated,
- the duplicates become the selected elements and they are placed in grab mode,
  so you can move them wherever you like.

If you select part of a chain, by duplicating it you will get a copy of the selected chain,
so the copied bones are interconnected exactly like the original ones.

The duplicate of a bone which is parented to another bone will also be parented to the same
bone, even if the root bone is not selected for the duplication. Be aware, though,
that if a bone is parented **and** connected to an unselected bone,
its copy will be parented, but **not** connected to the unselected bone
(see Fig. :ref:`fig-rig-bone-duplication`).

.. _fig-rig-bone-duplication:

.. list-table:: Duplication example.

   * - .. figure:: /images/rigging_armatures_editing_bones_duplication-1.png
          :width: 320px

          An armature with three selected bones and a selected single root.

     - .. figure:: /images/rigging_armatures_editing_bones_duplication-2.png
          :width: 320px

          The three duplicated bones. Note that the selected chain is preserved in the copy,
          and that Bone.006 is parented but not connected to Bone.001, as indicated by the black dashed line.
          Similarly, Bone.007 is parented but not connected to Bone.003.


Deleting Bones
==============

You have two ways to remove bones from an armature: the standard deletion,
and merging several bones in one.


Standard deletion
-----------------

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Edit Mode
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Armature --> Delete`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`X`

.. note::

   This tool works on selected bones: selected joints are ignored.


To delete a bone, you can:

- press :kbd:`X` and confirm, or
- use the menu :menuselection:`Armature --> Delete` and confirm.

If you delete a bone in a chain, its child(ren)
will be automatically re-parented to its own parent, but **not** connected,
to avoid deforming the whole armature.

.. list-table:: Deletion example.

   * - .. figure:: /images/rigging_armatures_editing_bones_deletion-1.png
          :width: 320px

          An armature with two selected bones, just before deletion.

     - .. figure:: /images/rigging_armatures_editing_bones_deletion-2.png
          :width: 320px

          The two bones have been deleted. Note that Bone.002,
          previously connected to the deleted Bone.001, is now parented but not connected to Bone.


Merge
-----

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Edit Mode
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Armature --> Merge`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`Alt-M`


You can merge together several selected bones, as long as they form a chain.
Each sub-chain formed by the selected bones will give one bone,
whose root will be the root of the root bone, and whose tip will be the tip of the tip bone.

Confirm by clicking on :menuselection:`Merge Selected Bones --> Within Chains`.

If another (non-selected) chain origins from inside of the merged chain of bones,
it will be parented to the resultant merged bone. If they were connected,
it will be connected to the new bone.

Here is a strange subtlety (see Fig. :ref:`fig-rig-bone-merge`): even though connected
(the root bone of the unmerged chain has no root sphere),
the bones are not visually connected. This will be done as soon as you edit one bone,
differently depending in which chain is the edited bone
(compare the bottom two images of the example to understand this better).

.. _fig-rig-bone-merge:

.. list-table:: Merge example.

   * - .. figure:: /images/rigging_armatures_editing_bones_merge-1.png
          :width: 320px

          An armature with a selected chain, and a single selected bone, just before merging.

     - .. figure:: /images/rigging_armatures_editing_bones_merge-2.png
          :width: 320px

          Bones Bone, Bone.001 and Bone.002 have been merged in Bone.006,
          whereas Bone.005 was not modified. Note Bone.003, connected to Bone.006 but not yet "really" connected.

   * - .. figure:: /images/rigging_armatures_editing_bones_merge-3.png
          :width: 320px

          Bone.004 has been rotated, and hence the tip of Bone.006 was moved to the root of Bone.003.

     - .. figure:: /images/rigging_armatures_editing_bones_merge-4.png
          :width: 320px

          The tip of Bone.006 has been translated, and hence the root of Bone.003 was moved to the tip of "Bone.006"


Subdividing Bones
=================

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Edit Mode
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Armature --> Subdivide`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`W 1`


You can subdivide bones, to get two or more bones where there was just one bone.
The tool will subdivide all selected bones, preserving the existing relationships:
the bones created from a subdivision always form a connected chain of bones.

To create two bones out of each selected bone:

- Press :kbd:`W` :menuselection:`--> Subdivide`, same as :kbd:`W-1`, or
- select :menuselection:`Armature --> Subdivide` from the header menu.

To create an arbitrary number of bones from each selected bone in the
Subdivide Multi Operator panel.

Number of Cuts
   Specifies the number of cuts. As in mesh editing,
   if you set *n* cuts, you will get *n* + 1 bones for each selected bone.


.. list-table:: Subdivision example.

   * - .. figure:: /images/rigging_armatures_editing_bones_subdivision-1.png
          :width: 320px

          An armature with one selected bone, just before multi-subdivision.

     - .. figure:: /images/rigging_armatures_editing_bones_subdivision-2.png
          :width: 320px

          The selected bone has been "cut" two times, giving three sub-bones.


Locking Bones
=============

You can prevent a bone from being transformed in *Edit Mode* in several ways:

.. The active bone can be locked clicking on *Lock*
   in the *Transform* panel (:kbd:`N` in a 3D View);

- All bones can be locked clicking on the *Lock* checkbox
  of their Transform panel in the *Bones* tab;
- Press :kbd:`Shift-W` :menuselection:`--> Toggle Settings --> Locked`
- Select :menuselection:`Armature --> Bone Settings --> Toggle a Setting`).

*If the root of a locked bone is connected to the tip of an unlocked bone,
it will not be locked*, i.e. you will be able to move it to your liking.
This means that in a chain of connected bones, when you lock one bone,
you only really lock its tip. With unconnected bones, the locking is effective on both joints of the bone.


X-Axis Mirror Editing
=====================

Another very useful tool is the *X-Axis Mirror* editing option by
:menuselection:`Tool panel --> Armature Options`, while Armature is selected in *Edit Mode*.
When you have pairs of bones of the same name with just a different "side suffix"
(e.g. ".R"/".L", or "_right"/"_left" ...), once this option is enabled,
each time you transform (move/rotate/scale...) a bone, its "other side" counterpart will be transformed accordingly,
through a symmetry along the armature local X axis.
As most rigs have at least one axis of symmetry (animals, humans, ...),
it is an easy way to spare you half of the editing work!

.. seealso::

   :ref:`naming bones <armature-editing-naming-bones>`.


Separating Bones in a new Armature
==================================

You can, as with meshes, separate the selected bones in a new armature object
:menuselection:`Armature --> Separate`, :kbd:`Ctrl-Alt-P` and of course,
in *Object Mode*, you can join all selected armatures in one
:menuselection:`Object --> Join Objects`, :kbd:`Ctrl-J`.
