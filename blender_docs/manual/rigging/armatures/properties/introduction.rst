Skeleton
   In this panel you can arrange sets of bones into different layers for easier manipulation.
Display
   This controls the way the bones appear in 3D View.
Bone Groups
   Bone Groups are meant to be used during the rig creation to define and
   assign a color to a meaningful set of bones.
Pose Library
   Allows you to save different properties (location, rotation, scale) for selected bones for later use.
Ghost
   Allows you to see a set of different  poses, very useful when animating.
Motion Paths
   In this panel you can enable visualization of the motion path your skeleton leaves when animated.
