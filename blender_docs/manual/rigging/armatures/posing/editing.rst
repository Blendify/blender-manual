   Pose Tools.


In *Pose Mode*, bones behave like objects. So the transform actions
(grab/rotate/scale, etc.) are very similar to the same ones in *Object* mode
(all available ones are regrouped in the :menuselection:`Pose --> Transform` sub-menu). However,
there are some important specificities:

- Bones' relationships are crucial (see :ref:`bone_relations_parenting`).
- The "transform center" of a given bone
  (i.e. its default pivot point, when it is the only selected one) is *its root*.
  Note by the way that some pivot point options seem to not work properly, In fact,
  except for the *3D Cursor* one, all others appear to always use the median point of the selection
  (and not e.g. the active bone's root when *Active Object* is selected, etc.).


Selecting Bones
===============

Selection in *Pose Mode* is very similar to the one in :doc:`Edit Mode </rigging/armatures/bones/selecting>`,
with a few specificities:

- You can only select *whole bones* in *Pose Mode*, not roots/tips...
- You can select bones based on their group and/or layer, through the *Select Grouped* pop-up menu :kbd:`Shift-G`:

  - To select all bones belonging to the same group(s) as the selected ones,
    use the *In Same Group* entry :kbd:`Shift-G-Numpad1`.
  - To select all bones belonging to the same layer(s) as the selected ones,
    use the *In Same Layer* entry :kbd:`Shift-G-Numpad2`.

Basic Posing
============

As previously noted,
bones' transformations are performed based on the *rest position* of the armature,
which is its state as defined in *Edit Mode*. This means that in rest position,
in *Pose Mode*, each bone has a scale of 1.0, and null rotation and position
(as you can see it in the *Transform Properties* panel, in the 3D Views,
:kbd:`N`).

.. figure:: /images/rigging_posing_editing_local-rotation.png

   An example of locally-Y-axis locked rotation, with two bones selected.
   Note that the two green lines materializing the axes are centered on the armature's center,
   and not each bone's root...


Moreover, the local space for these actions is the bone's own one
(visible when you enable the *Axes* option of the *Armature* panel).
This is especially important when using axis locking, for example,
there is no specific "bone roll" tool in *Pose Mode*,
as you can rotate around the bone's main axis just by locking on the local Y axis
:kbd:`R-Y-Y`... This also works with several bones selected;
each one is locked to its own local axis!

When you pose your armature,
you are supposed to have one or more objects skinned on it! And obviously,
when you transform a bone in *Pose Mode*,
its related objects or object's shape is moved/deformed accordingly, in real time.
Unfortunately, if you have a complex rig set-up and/or a heavy skin object,
this might produce lag, and make interactive editing very painful.
If you experience such troubles, try enabling the *Delay Deform* button of the
*Armature* panel the skin objects will only be updated once you validate the
transform operation.


Auto IK
=======

The auto IK option in the tool shelf enables a temporary ik constraint when posing bones.
The chain acts from the tip of the selected bone to root of the uppermost parent bone.
Note that this mode lacks options,
and only works by applying the resulting transform to the bones in the chain.


Rest Pose
=========

Once you have transformed some bones, if you want to return to their rest position,
just clear their transformations (usual :kbd:`Alt-G`/:kbd:`Alt-R`/:kbd:`Alt-S` shortcuts,
or :menuselection:`Pose --> Clear Transform --> Clear User Transform`, :kbd:`W-5`, to clear
everything at once... - commands also available in the :menuselection:`Pose --> Clear Transform` sub-menu).

Note that in *Envelope* visualization, :kbd:`Alt-S` does not clear the scale,
but rather scales the *Distance* influence area of the selected bones (also
available through the :menuselection:`Pose --> Scale Envelope Distance` menu entry,
which is only effective in *Envelope* visualization, even though it is always available...).

Conversely, you may define the current pose as the new rest position (i.e.
"apply" current transformations to the *Edit Mode*),
using the :menuselection:`Pose --> Apply Pose as Restpose` menu entry
(or :kbd:`Ctrl-A` and confirm the pop-up menu). When you do so,
the skinned objects/geometry is **also** reset to its default, undeformed state,
which generally means you will have to skin it again.

Whereas in *Edit Mode*, you always see your armature in its rest position,
in *Object Mode* and *Pose Mode* you see it by default in its *pose position*
(i.e. as it was transformed in the *Pose Mode*).
If you want to see it in the rest position in all modes,
enable the *Rest Position* button in the *Armature* tab (*Edit Mode*).


In-Betweens
===========

There are several tools for editing poses in an animation.

Relax Pose :menuselection:`Pose --> In-Betweens --> Relax Pose`, :kbd:`Alt-E`
   Relax pose is somewhat related to the above topic, but it is only useful with keyframed bones
   (see the :doc:`animation chapter </animation/index>`).
   When you edit such a bone (and hence take it "away" from its "keyed position"),
   using this command will progressively "bring it back" to its "keyed position",
   with smaller and smaller steps as it comes near it.

Push Pose :menuselection:`Pose --> In-Betweens --> Relax Pose`, :kbd:`Ctrl-E`
   Push pose exaggerates the current pose.

Breakdowner :menuselection:`Pose --> In-Betweens --> Pose Breakdowner`, :kbd:`Shift-E`
   Creates a suitable breakdown pose on the current frame


There are also in *Pose Mode* a bunch of armature-specific editing options/tools,
like :ref:`auto-bones naming <armature-editing-naming-bones>`,
:ref:`properties switching/enabling/disabling <armature-bone-properties>`, etc.,
that we already described in the armature editing pages. See the links above...


Copy/Paste Pose
===============

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Pose Mode
   | Panel:    *3D View* header (|copy-paste|)
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Pose --> Copy Current Pose`,
     :menuselection:`Pose --> Paste Pose`, :menuselection:`Pose --> Paste Flipped Pose`


Blender allows you to copy and paste a pose, either through the *Pose* menu, or
directly using the three "copy/paste" buttons found at the right part of the 3D Views header:

:menuselection:`Pose --> Copy Current Pose`
   to copy the current pose of selected bones into the pose buffer.
:menuselection:`Pose --> Paste Pose`
   paste the buffered pose to the currently posed armature.
:menuselection:`Pose --> Paste Flipped Pose`
   paste the *X axis mirrored* buffered pose to the currently posed armature.


Here are important points:

- This tool works at the Blender session level, which means you can use it across armatures, scenes, and even files.
  However, the pose buffer is not saved, so you lose it when you close Blender.
- There is only one pose buffer.
- Only the selected bones are taken into account during copying (i.e. you copy only selected bones' pose).
- During pasting, on the other hand, bone selection has no importance.
  The copied pose is applied on a per-name basis
  (i.e. if you had a ``forearm`` bone selected when you copied the pose,
  the ``forearm`` bone of the current posed armature will get its pose when you paste it --
  and if there is no such named bone, nothing will happen...).
- What is copied and pasted is in fact the position/rotation/scale of each bone, in its own space.
  This means that the resulting pasted pose might be very different from the originally copied one, depending on:
  - The rest position of the bones, and
  - The current pose of their parents.
