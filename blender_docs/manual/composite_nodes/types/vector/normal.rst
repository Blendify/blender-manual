   Normal Node

The Normal node generates a normal vector and a dot product.
Click and Drag on the sphere to set the direction of the normal.

This node can be used to input a new normal vector into the mix. For example,
use this node as an input to a Color Mix node.
Use an Image input as the other input to the Mixer.
The resulting colorized output can be easily varied by moving the light source
(click and dragging the sphere).
