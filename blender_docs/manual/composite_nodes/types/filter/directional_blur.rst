*********************
Directional Blur Node
*********************

Blurs an image in a specified direction and magnitude. Can be used to fake motion blur.


Options
=======

Iterations
   Controls how may times the image is duplicated to create the blur effect. Higher values give smoother results.
Wrap
   Wraps the image on the X and Y axis to fill in areas that become transparent from the blur effect.
Center
   Sets the position where the blur center is. This makes a difference if the angle, spin, and/or zoom are used.

Distance
   How large the blur effect is.
Angle
   Image is blurred at this angle from the center

Spin
   Rotates the image each iteration to create a spin effect, from the center point.
Zoom
   Scales the image each iteration, creating the effect of a zoom.
