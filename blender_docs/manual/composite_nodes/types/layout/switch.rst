   Switch Node

Switch between two images using a checkbox. When the checkbox is checked, the 'On' input is output.
When it is unchecked the 'Off' input is output instead.
Switch state may be animated by adding a :doc:`keyframe </animation/key_frames>`
This makes the Switch node useful for bypassing nodes which are not wanted during part of a sequence.
