Animating Sketches
******************

Use the Grease Pencil to do basic pencil tests (e.g. 2D animation in flipbook style).
Sketches are stored on the frame that they were drawn on, as a separate drawing
(only on the layer that they exist on).
Each drawing is visible until the next drawing for that layer is encountered.
The only exception to this is the first drawing for a layer,
which will also be visible before the frame it was drawn on.

Therefore, it is simple to make a pencil-test/series of animated sketches:

#. Go to first relevant frame. Draw.
#. Jump to next relevant frame. Draw some more.
#. Keep repeating process, and drawing until satisfied. Voila! Animated sketches.
