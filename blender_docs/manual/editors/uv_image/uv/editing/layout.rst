Layout
******

After unwrap, you will likely need to arrange the UV maps into something that can be logically
textured or painted. Your goals for editing are:

- Stitch some pieces (UV maps) back together.
- Minimize wasted space in the image.
- Enlarge the faces where you want more detail.
- Re-size/enlarge the faces that are stretched.
- Shrink the faces that are too grainy and have too much detail.

With a minimum of dead space,
the most pixels can be dedicated to giving the maximum detail and fineness to the UV Texture.
A UV face can be as small as a pixel (the little dots that make up an image)
or as large as an entire image. You probably want to make some major adjustments first,
and then tweak the layout.


Transforms
==========

   | Mode:     View Mode and Mask Mode
   | Panel:    :menuselection:`Tool Shelf --> Tools --> Transform`
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`UVs --> Transform`

- Translate :kbd:`G`
- Rotate :kbd:`R`
- Scale :kbd:`S`
- Shear :kbd:`Shift-Ctrl-Alt-S`


Axis Locking
------------

Transformations can be locked to an axis by pressing :kbd:`X` or :kbd:`Y` after one of the transform tools.
Also, holding the :kbd:`MMB` will constrain movement to the X or Y axis.

UV Options

   | Mode:     View Mode and Mask Mode
   | Panel:    :menuselection:`Tool Shelf --> Options --> UV Options`
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`UVs`

Live Unwrap
   Continuously unwraps the selected UV islands while transforming pinned vertices.
Snap to pixel
   Will force the UVs to snap to the nearest pixels of an image if loaded.
Constraining to Image Bounds
   Turning on *Constrain to Image Bounds* will prevent UVs from being moved outside the 0 to 1 UV range.


.. _bpy.ops.uv.pin:

Pin and Unpin
=============

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     View mode
   | Panel:    :menuselection:`Tool Shelf --> Tools --> UV Tools --> UV Unwrap: Pin/Unpin`
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`UVs --> Pin/Unpin`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`P`, :kbd:`Alt-P`

You can pin UVs so they do not move between multiple unwrap operations.
When Unwrapping a model it is sometimes useful to "Lock" certain UVs,
so that parts of a UV layout stay the same shape, and/or in the same place.
Pinning is done by selecting a UV, then selecting *Pin* from the *UVs* menu,
or the shortcut :kbd:`P`. You can *Unpin a UV* with the shortcut :kbd:`Alt-P`.

Pinning is most effective when using the Unwrap method of UV mapping, for organic objects.
An example is when you are modeling a symmetrical object using
the :doc:`Mirror Modifier </modeling/modifiers/generate/mirror>`.
Some of the UVs on the mirror axis may be shared across the mirrored counterparts.
You could pin the UVs that correspond to the midline, then align them on the X axis,
and they will stay in that location.

Pinning also work great with the Live Unwrap tool. If you pin two or more UVs,
with Live Unwrap on, dragging pinned UVs will interactively unwrap the model.
This helps with fitting a UV island to a certain shape or region.


Seams
=====

Pack Islands
============

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Panel:    :menuselection:`Tool Shelf --> Tools --> UV Tools --> Pack Islands`
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`UVs --> Pack Islands`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`Ctrl-P`

The *Pack Islands* tool generates an optimized UV layout with non-overlapping islands
that tries to efficiently fill the texture space.

First it will uniformly scale the selected island,
then individually transform each island so that they fill up the UV space as much as possible.

.. _uv-image-export-layout:

Export UV Layout
================

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     View mode
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`UVs --> Export UV Layout`

Using your favorite image painting program, you could use an exported UV layout to create a texture.
Then save your changes, and back in Blender, use the :menuselection:`Image --> Open`
to load it as your UV image for the mesh in Edit Mode for the desired (and active) UV map.

As a way of communicating to an artist who is painting your UV Texture for you,
Blender has a tool called *Save UV Face Layout*
(located in the UV/Image Editor, :menuselection:`UVs --> Save UV Face Layout`)
that saves an image as a ``Targa`` (``.tga``), ``EPS``, or an ``SVG`` format for the object you have selected.

The image is an outline of the UV face mapping.
Activating the tool brings up the File Browser with options for saving the layout:

.. figure:: /images/editors_uv-image_uv_editing_layout_export-panel.png

   Export Options.

All UVs
   if disabled, then only the UV faces selected will be outlined.
Modified
   Export UVs from the modified mesh.
Format
   Select the type of image file to save (``.png``, ``.eps``, ``.svg``).
Size
   select the size of the image in pixels. The image be square.
Fill Opacity
   Set the opacity of the fill.

The image will be lines defining the UV edges that are within the image area of the UV mapping area.
Edges outside the boundary, even if selected, will not be shown in the saved graphic.

The artist will use this as a transparent layer in their paint program as a guide when painting your texture.
The example below shows Blender in the background, and the Gimp working on the texture,
using the saved layout as a guide. Note that ``targa`` format supports the Alpha channel,
so you can paint transparent areas of the mesh.

For using images as textures, see the page on
:doc:`Image Textures </render/blender_render/textures/types/image/index>`.

   | Header:   :menuselection:`Pivot Point`

The UV/Image editor has a 2D cursor. Its position can be changed by :kbd:`LMB`
clicking in the UV/Image editor. You can also manually adjust its position in the Properties region.
The range by default is from 0 to 256 starting from the lower left corner.
By enabling *Normalized* under *Coordinates*, the range changes from 0 to 1.

The Pivot Point can be changed to:

- Bounding Box Center
- Median Point
- 2D Cursor Location

   :class: refbox

   | Editor:   3D View
   | Mode:     Edit mode
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Mesh --> Face --> Rotate UVs/Reverse UVs`

The orientation of the UV Texture is defined by each face.
If the image is, for example, upside down or laying on its side,
use the :menuselection:`Face --> Rotate UVs` (in the 3D View in Face Select mode)
menu to rotate the UVs per face in 90-degree turns.

The :menuselection:`Face --> Reverse UVs` tool mirrors the UVs per face,
which flips the image over, showing you the image reversed.
