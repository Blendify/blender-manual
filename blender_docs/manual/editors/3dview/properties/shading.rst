Viewport Shading

   The Viewport Shading menu.

Shading refers to the way objects are drawn and lit in the 3D View.

Bounding Box
   Only shows rectangular boxes that outline an object's size and shape.
Wireframe
   Objects appear as a mesh of lines representing the edges of faces and surfaces.
Solid
   The default drawing mode using solid colored surfaces and simple lighting.
Textured
   Shows meshes with an image applied using the mesh's active UV Map.
   For Cycles materials, the image is the last one selected in the
   :doc:`Node Editor </editors/node_editor/index>`. For other render engines,
   the UV Map's applied face texture will be shown.
Material
   A fast approximation of the applied material.
Rendered
   An accurate representation using the selected *Render Engine* and lit with the visible scene lights.

Except for *Rendered*, these shading modes are not dependent on light sources in the scene.
Instead they use a simple default lighting adjusted by the *Solid OpenGL Lights*
controls on the *System* tab of the :doc:`User Preferences </preferences/system>` editor.

The viewport shading controls the appearance of all objects in a scene,
but this can be overridden for individual objects using the *Display panel* in their *Object Properties*.

Shading Panel

   3D View Shading Panel.


The shading panel in the Properties Region provides additional control over the way objects in the 3D View appear.

Textured Solid
   Display assigned :ref:`face textures <face-textures>` in the *Solid* shading mode.
   (*not* available in the Cycles Render Engine).
Shadeless
   Textured mode only -- Draws textures without shading. Its most common use case is texture painting.
Matcap
   "Matcaps" are images mapped on a normal.
   It provides a quick way to define visible material properties for modeling and sculpting.
   Because Matcap rendering fully bypasses the material shader code, it's a very fast rendering option.
   The selected Matcap is a setting per 3D View. This way you can have multiple views drawing different Matcaps.
   (Solid Viewport shading only).
Backface Culling
   Only show the front side of faces. Use this to find faces flipped the wrong way,
   especially when exporting to programs that use single sided drawing.
Hidden Wire
   Show only front-facing wireframes. This is useful for a retopology workflow.
   Tip: Optimally this could be combined with the *X-Ray* display setting.
   (Mesh, Edit Mode only).
Depth of Field
   Simulates a camera's focal blur effect in the 3D View. This is only visible in a camera view.
   Control the effect using these options in the :ref:`Properties Tab <camera-settings>`
   of the active camera: Focal Length, Sensor Size, Focus Object or Focus Distance, and Viewport F-stop.
Ambient Occlusion
   Improves the realism of the viewport image by simulating the darkening effect that
   occurs in crevices and corners. This is done by raycasting in screen space.
   Typically such effects are rendered at higher quality,
   but this is a quick real-time preview which can help when modeling or sculpting.

   Strength
      This factor directly multiplies the computed color of the effect,
      so increasing this value gives a stronger effect.
   Distance
      The maximum world space distance the effect is computed in.
      I.e. how far out of the corners does the effect extend.
   Attenuation
      How strongly the effect attenuates with distance.
      Increasing this makes far away surfaces contribute less to the effect.
      Use this to get rid of some banding artifacts.
   Samples
      The number of samples used for the effect.
      Low numbers produce a grainy effect, but the actual number used is squared so use high numbers with caution.
   Color
      Color of the effect, can be modified to give a different feel, from ambient lighting to dirt/rust.
