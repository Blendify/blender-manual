There can be many objects in a scene: A typical stage scene consists of furniture, props,
lights, and backdrops.
Blender helps you keep everything organized by allowing you to group like objects together.

.. _fig-view3d-grouped-objects:

.. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_object_properties_relations_grouped-cubes.png

   Grouped objects.


Group objects together without any kind of transformation relationship.
Use groups to just logically organize your scene,
or to facilitate one-step appending or linking between files or across scenes.
Objects that are part of a group always shows as light green when selected.
See Fig. :ref:`fig-view3d-grouped-objects`.

Dupligroup Visibility
   Restricting Group Contents via Layers The cluster of layer buttons attached to each group determines from
   which layers the group objects will be included when duplicated.
   If your group contains objects on layers 10, 11 and 12,
   but you disable the layer 12 button in the group controls, duplicates of that group (using the
   :doc:`Dupligroup </editors/3dview/object/properties/duplication/dupligroup>`
   feature) will only show the portions of the group that reside in layers 10 and 11.
Offset
