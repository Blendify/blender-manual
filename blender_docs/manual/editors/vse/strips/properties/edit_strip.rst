The *Edit Strip* panel is used to control placement and properties of strips.

Name
   You can name or rename your strips here.
Type
   Displays the type of strip selected.
Blend Mode
   Controls how the strip affects other strips.
   See :term:`Color Blend Modes` for details on each blending mode.
Opacity
   Set the opacity of the strip.
Mute (eye icon)
   Hides the strip so that it does not participate in the final image computation
Lock (padlock icon)
   Prevents the strip from being moved.
Channel
   Changes the channel number, or row, of the strip.
Start Frame
   Changes the starting frame number of the strip, which is the same as grabbing and moving the strip.

   .. tip::

      When you add a strip, just drop the strip and then use *Start Frame* to place it at the desired frame.
      This helpful when it is hard to drag and drop in exactly the right place.

Length
   Specify the number of frames to use for the strip.
