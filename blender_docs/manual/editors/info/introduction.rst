   This label displays the Blender version.
Resource Information
   Scene
      Displays information about the current loaded scene dependent on the mode and object type.
      When two numbers are shown, the first one means the selected, and the second one means the total count.
      This can be the number of vertices, faces, triangles or bones, as well as the selected objects and lamps.
   Memory
      The "Mem" label shows the calculated memory consumption by Blender.
      This can help to identify, when you are reaching the limits of your hardware.
   Active Object
      The object type of the current selected object.


.. _info-report-console:

Report Console
==============

When the Info Editor's area is scaled up, it reveals the Report console,
where a scripting trail is displayed.
Whenever an operator has been executed, it leaves a report, creating a log.
