Script and Templates
--------------------

The most notable keystroke is :kbd:`Alt-P` which makes the content of the buffer being parsed by the internal Python
interpreter built into Blender.
Before going on it is worth noticing that Blender comes with a fully functional Python interpreter built in,
and with a lots of Blender-specific modules,
as described in the :doc:`/advanced/scripting/index` section.

The *Text Editor* has now also some dedicated Python scripts,
which add some useful writing tools, like a class/function/variable browser, completion...
You can access them through the Template menu in the header.


Main View
=========

Typing on the keyboard produces text in the text buffer.
As usual, pressing, dragging and releasing :kbd:`LMB` selects text.

.. tip:: Usages for the Text editor

   The Text editor is handy also when you want to share your blend-files with others.
   The Text editor can be used to write in a ``README`` text explaining the contents of your blend-file.
   Be sure to keep it visible when saving!
