  Motion Tracking
##################

Introduction
============

Motion Tracking is used to track the motion of objects and applying that data to 3D object through the compositor.
Blender's motion tracker supports a couple of very powerful tools for 2D tracking and 3D motion tracking,
including camera tracking and object tracking, as well as some special features like the plane track for compositing.
Tracks can also be used to move and deform masks for rotoscoping in the Mask Editor,
which is available as a special mode in the Movie Clip Editor.


Manual Lens Calibration
=======================

All cameras record distorted video.
Nothing can be done about this because of the manner in which optical lenses work.
For accurate camera motion,
the exact value of the focal length and the "strength" of distortion are needed.

Currently, focal length can be automatically obtained only from the camera's settings or from
the EXIF information. There are some tools which can help to find approximate values to compensate for distortion.
There are also fully manual tools where you can use a grid which is getting affected by distortion model and deformed
cells defines straight lines in the footage.

You can also use the grease pencil for this - just draw a line which should be straight on the footage using poly
line brush and adjust the distortion values to make the grease pencil match lines on the footage.

To calibrate your camera more accurately, use the grid calibration tool from OpenCV.
OpenCV is using the same distortion model, so it shouldn't be a problem.


Camera and Object Motion Solving
================================

Blender not only supports the solving of camera motion, including tripod shots,
but also the solving of object motion in relation to the motion of the camera.
In addition to that there is the Plane Track, which solves the motion of all markers on one plane.

There are also plans to add more tools in the future, for example more automatic tracking and solving,
multi-camera solving and constrained solutions.


Tools for Scene Orientation and Stabilization
=============================================

After solve, you need to orient the real scene in the 3D scene for more convenient compositing.
There are tools to define the floor, the scene origin, and the X/Y axes to perform scene orientation.

If something is needed to stabilize video from the camera to make the final result looks
nicer, 2D stabilization is available to help. It stabilizes video from the camera,
which can compensate for camera jumps and tilt.
