Node Editor Actions
===================

When the cursor is in the area, several standard Blender hotkeys and mouse actions are available, including:

Search... (add menu)
   Brings up a pop-up menu, allowing you to search the available nodes.
Undo
   :kbd:`Ctrl-Z`
Redo
   :kbd:`Ctrl-Y` or :kbd:`Ctrl-Shift-Z` -- You can use this if you used "undo" a bit too often.
