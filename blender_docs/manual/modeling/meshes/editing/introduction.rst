Introduction

Blender provides a variety of tools for editing meshes.
These are tools used to add, duplicate, move and delete elements.

These are available through the Menus in the 3D View header, and context menus in the 3D View,
as well as individual shortcut keys.

.. note::

   All the "transform precision/snap" keys :kbd:`Ctrl` and/or :kbd:`Shift`
   work also for all these advanced operations... However, most of them do not have
   :doc:`axis locking </scene_layout/object/editing/transform/control/axis_locking>` possibilities,
   and some of them do not take into account
   :doc:`pivot point </scene_layout/object/editing/transform/control/pivot_point/index>` and/or
   :doc:`transform orientation </scene_layout/object/editing/transform/control/orientations>`
   either.

These transform tools are available
in the *Transform* section of the *Mesh* menu in the header.
Note that, some of these can also be used on other editable objects,
like curves, surfaces, and lattices.


Accessing Mesh Tools
====================

The mesh tools are found in various places, and available through shortcuts as well.


Menus
-----

These menus are located in the header.
Some of the menus can be accessed with shortcuts:

- :kbd:`Ctrl-F` brings up the Face tool menu
- :kbd:`Ctrl-E` brings up the Edge tool menu
- :kbd:`Ctrl-V` brings up the Vertex tool menu
