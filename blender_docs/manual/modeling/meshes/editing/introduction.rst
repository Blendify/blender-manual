Introduction

Blender provides a variety of tools for editing meshes.
These are tools used to add, duplicate, move and delete elements.

These are available through the *Mesh Tools* shelf,
the Mesh menu in the 3D View header, and context menus in the 3D View,
as well as individual shortcut keys.

.. note::

   All the "transform precision/snap" keys :kbd:`Ctrl` and/ or :kbd:`Shift`
   work also for all these advanced operations... However, most of them do not have
   :doc:`axis locking </editors/3dview/object/transform/control/precision/axis_locking>` possibilities,
   and some of them do not take into account
   :doc:`pivot point </editors/3dview/object/transform/control/pivot_point/index>` and/or
   :doc:`transform orientation </editors/3dview/object/transform/control/orientations>`
   either.

These transform tools are available in the *Transform* section of the
*Mesh* menu in the header.
Note that some of these can also be used on other editable objects, like curves, surfaces,
and lattices.


Accessing Mesh Tools
====================

The mesh tools are found in various places, and available through shortcuts as well.


Mesh Tools Shelf
----------------

When you select a mesh and :kbd:`Tab` into edit mode,
the *Tool Shelf* changes from *Object Tools* to *Mesh Tools*.
These are only some of the mesh editing tools.


Menus
-----

The *Mesh* menu is located in the header.
Some of the menus can be accessed with shortcuts:
:kbd:`Ctrl-F` brings up the Face tool menu
:kbd:`Ctrl-E` brings up the Edge tool menu
:kbd:`Ctrl-V` brings up the Vertex tool menu
