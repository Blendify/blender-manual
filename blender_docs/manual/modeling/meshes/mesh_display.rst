This panel is available only in edit mode, when the object being edited is a mesh.


Overlays
========

The Overlays section provides controls for highlighting parts of the mesh.

Edges
   Toggles the option to see the selected edges highlighted.
   If enabled the edges that have both vertices selected will be highlighted.
   This only affects in vertex selection mode and when
   :doc:`UV Unwrapping </editors/uv_image/uv_editing/unwrapping/seams>`.
Faces
   Defines if the selected faces will be highlighted in the
   :doc:`3D View </editors/3dview/properties/index>`.
   This affects all selection modes.
Creases and Bevel Weight
   Highlights edges marked with a crease weight for the
   :doc:`Subdivision Surface Modifier </modeling/modifiers/generate/subsurf>`
   and/or a bevel weight for the :doc:`Bevel Modifier </modeling/modifiers/generate/bevel>`,
   respectively. In both cases, the higher the weight, the brighter the highlight.
Seams and Sharp
   Highlights edges marked as a UV seam for unwrapping and/or sharp edges for the
   :doc:`Edge Split Modifier </modeling/modifiers/generate/edge_split>`
Edge Marks and Face Marks
