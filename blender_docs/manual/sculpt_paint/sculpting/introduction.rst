Overview
========

*Sculpt Mode* is similar to *Edit Mode* in that it is used to alter the shape of a model,
but Sculpt Mode uses a very different workflow:
instead of dealing with individual elements (vertices, edges, and faces),
an area of the model is altered using a brush.
In other words, instead of selecting a group of vertices,
Sculpt Mode manipulates geometry in the brushes region of influence.


Sculpt Mode
===========

Sculpt mode is selected from the mode menu of the *3D View* header.
Once sculpt mode is activated, the Tool Shelf of the *3D View* will change
to sculpt mode specific panels. The panels will be *Brush*,
*Texture*, *Tool*, *Symmetry*, *Stroke*, *Curve*, *Appearance*, and *Options*.
A red circle will appear and follow the location of the cursor in the 3D View.

.. note::

   To have a predictable brush behavior, apply the scale of your mesh.

Sculpt Menus

Here you can select the type of brush preset to use.
*Reset Brush* will return the settings of a brush to its defaults.
You can also set Blender to use the current brush for *Vertex Paint Mode*,
*Weight Paint Mode*, and *Texture Paint Mode* using the toggle buttons.
