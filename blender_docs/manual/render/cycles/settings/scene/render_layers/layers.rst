This section covers only the Render Layer settings appropriate for the Blender Renderer.
For the engine-independent settings, see :doc:`this section </render/post_process/layers>`.

   however, sometimes it is useful to leave out some object influence for a particular render layer.
Material
   Overrides all materials in the render layer.
Samples
   Render layer samples to override the scene samples.
   Controlled by the :ref:`layer samples <render-cycles-integrator-layer-samples>` in the sampling panel.
Use Environment
   Disables rendering the *Environment* render pass in the final render.
Use AO
   Disables rendering the *Ambient Occlusion* render pass in the final render.
Use Surfaces
   Disables rendering object materials in the final render.
Use Hair
   Disables rendering hair strands in the final render.
