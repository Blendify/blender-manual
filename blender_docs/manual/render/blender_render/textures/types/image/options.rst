Image
=====

In the *Image* panel we tell Blender which source file to use.

Image
   The Image :ref:`ui-data-block`. For the options see :doc:`/editors/uv_image/image/image_settings`.


Image Sampling
==============

In the *Image Sampling* panel we can control how the information is retrieved from the image.

.. list-table::

   * - .. figure:: /images/render_blender-render_textures_types_image_options_bahnhofstrasse.jpg
          :width: 320px

          Background image.

     - .. figure:: /images/render_blender-render_textures_types_image_options_map-to-eingabewerte.png
          :width: 320px

          Foreground image.

The two images presented here are used to demonstrate the different image options.
The *background image* is an ordinary JPG-file,
the *foreground image* is a PNG-file with various alpha and grayscale values.
The vertical bar on the right side of the foreground image is an Alpha blend,
the horizontal bar has 50% alpha.

.. list-table::

   * - .. figure:: /images/render_blender-render_textures_types_image_options_usealpha.jpg
          :width: 320px

          Foreground image with *Use* alpha. The alpha values of the pixels are evaluated.

     - .. figure:: /images/render_blender-render_textures_types_image_options_calcalpha.jpg
          :width: 320px

          Foreground image with *Calculate* alpha.

Alpha
   Options related to transparency.

   Use
      Works with PNG and TGA files since they can save transparency information (Foreground Image with Use Alpha).
      Where the alpha value in the image is less than 1.0,
      the object will be partially transparent and stuff behind it will show.
   Calculate
      Calculate an alpha based on the RGB values of the Image.
      Black (0, 0, 0) is transparent, white (1, 1, 1) opaque.
      Enable this option if the image texture is a mask.
      Note that mask images can use shades of gray that translate to semi-transparency,
      like ghosts, flames, and smoke/fog.
   Invert
      Reverses the alpha value.
      Use this option if the mask image has white where you want it transparent and vice versa.

Flip X/Y Axis
   Rotates the image 90 degrees counterclockwise when rendered.

   Image Sampling panel.

Normal Map
   This tells Blender that the image is to be used to create the illusion of a bumpy surface,
   with each of the three RGB channels controlling how to fake a shadow from a surface irregularity.
   Needs specially prepared input pictures.
   See :doc:`Bump and Normal Maps </render/blender_render/textures/properties/influence/bump_normal>`.

   Normal Map Space:
      - *Tangent*
      - *Object*
      - *World*
      - *Camera*

Derivative Map
   Use red and green as derivative values.

MIP Map
   `MIP Maps <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mipmap>`__ are pre-calculated, smaller,
   filtered Textures for a certain size. A series of pictures is generated, each half the size of the former one.
   This optimizes the filtering process. By default, this option is enabled and speeds up rendering
   (especially useful in the :doc:`Game Engine </game_engine/index>`). When this option is OFF,
   you generally get a sharper image, but this can significantly increase calculation time if the filter dimension
   (see below) becomes large. Without MIP Maps you may get varying pictures from slightly different camera angles,
   when the Textures become very small. This would be noticeable in an animation.

   MIP Map Gaussian filter
      Used in conjunction with MIP Map, it enables the MIP Map to be made smaller based on color similarities.
      In the :doc:`Game Engine </game_engine/index>`, you want your textures,
      especially your MIP Map textures, to be as small as possible to increase rendering speed and frame rate.

Interpolation
   This option interpolates the pixels of an image.
   This becomes visible when you enlarge the picture. By default, this option is on.
   Turn this option off to keep the individual pixels visible and if they are correctly anti-aliased.
   This last feature is useful for regular patterns, such as lines and tiles;
   they remain 'sharp' even when enlarged considerably.
   When you enlarge this 10×10 pixel Image |small-pic|
   the difference with and without *Interpolation* is clearly visible.
   Turn this image off if you are using digital photos to preserve crispness.

        - .. figure:: /images/render_blender-render_textures_types_image_options_interpolation-on.png

Filter
   The filter size used in rendering, and also by the options *MipMap* and *Interpolation*.
   If you notice gray lines or outlines around the textured object, particularly where the image is transparent,
   turn this value down from 1.0 to 0.1 or so.

   Texture Filter Type
      Texture filter to use for image sampling.
      Just like a *pixel* represents a *pic* ture *el* ement, a *texel* represents a *tex* ture *el* ement.
      When a texture (2D texture space) is mapped onto a 3D model (3D model space),
      different algorithms can be used to compute a value for each pixel based on samplings from several texels.

      Box
         A fast and simple nearest-neighbor interpolation known as Monte Carlo integration
      EWA (Elliptical Weighted Average)
         One of the most efficient direct
         convolution algorithms developed by Paul Heckbert and Ned Greene in the 1980s.
         For each texel, EWA samples, weights, and accumulates texels within an elliptical
         footprint and then divides the result by the sum of the weights.

         Eccentricity
            Maximum Eccentricity. Higher values give less blur at distant/oblique angles, but is slower
      FELINE (Fast Elliptical Lines)
         Uses several isotropic probes at several points along a line in texture space to produce an anisotropic
         filter to reduce aliasing artifacts without considerably increasing rendering time.

         Probes
            Number of probes to use. An integer between 1 and 256.

      Area
         Area filter to use for image sampling.

         Eccentricity
            Maximum Eccentricity. Higher values give less blur at distant/oblique angles, but is slower.

   Filter Size
      The filter size used by MIP Map and Interpolation.
   Minimum Filter Size
      Use Filter Size as a minimal filter value in pixels.


Image Mapping
=============

.. figure:: /images/render_blender-render_textures_types_image_options_image-mapping-panel.png

   Image Mapping panel.

In the *Image Mapping* panel,
we can control how the image is mapped or projected onto the 3D model.

Extension
   Extend
      Outside the image the colors of the edges are extended.
   Clip
      Clip to image size and set exterior pixels as transparent.
      Outside the image, an alpha value of 0.0 is returned.
      This allows you to 'paste' a small logo on a large object.
   Clip Cube
      Clips to cubic-shaped area around the images and sets exterior pixels as transparent.
      The same as Clip, but now the 'Z' coordinate is calculated as well.
      An alpha value of 0.0 is returned outside a cube-shaped area around the image.
   Repeat
      The image is repeated horizontally and vertically.

      Repeat
         X/Y repetition multiplier.
      Mirror
         Mirror on X/Y axes. This buttons allow you to map the texture as a mirror, or automatic flip of the image,
         in the corresponding X and/or Y direction.
   Checker
      Checkerboards quickly made.
      You can use the option *size* on the *Mapping* panel as well to create the desired number of checkers.

      Even / Odd
         Set even/odd tiles.
      Distance
         Governs the distance between the checkers in parts of the texture size.

Crop Minimum / Crop Maximum
   The offset and the size of the texture in relation to the texture space.
   Pixels outside this space are ignored.
   Use these to crop, or choose a portion of a larger image to use as the texture.
