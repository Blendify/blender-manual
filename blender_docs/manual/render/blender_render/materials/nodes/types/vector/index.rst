  Vector Nodes
################

Vector nodes manipulate information about how light interacts with the material,
multiplying vector sets, and other wonderful things which can become quite advanced.
Even if you do not have experience with vector math, you will find these nodes to be very useful.

Vectors, in general, are two or three element values, for example,
surface normals are vectors. Vectors are also important for calculating shading.
