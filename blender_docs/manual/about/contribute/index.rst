Whether you like to fix a tiny spelling mistake or rewrite an entire chapter,
your help with the Blender manual is most welcome!


How It Works
============

You can modify the manual by editing local text files.
These files are kept in sync with those online via a repository,
based on this the server will update the online manual.

The manual is written in the `reStructuredText <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html>`__
(RST) markup language and can be edited using a plain text editor.
For a local preview, you convert (build) the manual source files from RST into HTML web pages.
