3D Cursor as Pivot
******************

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     *Object mode* and *Edit mode*
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`.`


The 3D cursor is the most intuitive of the pivot points.
With the 3D cursor selected as the active pivot point
(from either the *Window Header* or via the :kbd:`.` hotkey),
simply position the 3D cursor and then do the required transformation. All rotation and
scaling transformations will now be done relative to the location of the 3D cursor.
The image below shows the difference when rotating an Object from its starting position
(first panel) 90 degrees around the median point (second panel)
and 90 degrees around the 3D cursor (third panel).
