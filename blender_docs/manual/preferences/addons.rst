The Add-ons tab lets you manage secondary scripts, called "Add-ons" that extends Blender's functionality.
In this tab you can search, install, enable and disable Add-ons.

Searching
=========

Blender comes with some useful Add-ons already, ready to be enabled. But you can also add your own,
or any interesting ones you find on the web.


Filtering
---------

Supported Level
   Blender's add-ons are split into two groups depending on who writes/supports them:

   - Official: Add-ons that are written by Blender developers.
   - Community: Add-ons that are written by people in the Blender community.

Categories
   Add-ons are divided into categories by what areas of Blender they affect.


Enabling and Disabling
======================

Enable and disable an add-on by checking or unchecking the box on the right of the add-on you chose,
as shown in the figure.

.. figure:: /images/preferences_addons_enable.png

   Enabling an Add-on.

The add-on functionality should be immediately available.
If the Add-on does not activate when enabled,
check the :doc:`Console window </advanced/command_line/introduction>`
for any errors, that may have occurred.

Add-on Information
==================

You can click the arrow at the left of the add-on box to see more information, such as
its location, a description and a link to the documentation.
Here you can also find a button to report a bug specific of this add-on.

.. tip:: Saving Add-on Preferences

   If you want an Add-on to be enabled every time you start Blender,
   you will need to *Save User Settings*.

Individual Activation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Add-ons that activate or change multiple hotkeys now have a special system of activation.
For example, with the "UI: Pie Menu Official" add-on
for each menu there's a selection box to activate the menu and its hotkey.

With Pie menus, First you activate the add-on. This activates the "Add-ons Preferences Submodule Activation".
You then need to expand the Add-ons Preferences, then you will see the list of Pie Menu types you can choose from.
From here you can individually activate the menus you like to use.
If the menu conflicts with another favorite, there's no need to activate it.
You can activate any combination & save as user settings
so your activations are available next time you start Blender.

Install from File
   For add-ons that you found on the web or your own to show on the list, you have to install them first
   by clicking *Install from File...* and providing a ``.zip`` or ``.py`` file.

   Now the add-on will be installed, not automatically enabled.
   The search field will be set to the add-on's name (to avoid having to look for it).
   Enable the add-on by turning on the check-box.

Refresh
   Scans the :doc:`Add-on Directory </getting_started/installing/configuration/directories>` for new add-ons.

Online Resources
   This menu contains a list of helpful links for both users
   and people who are interested in writing their own add-on.

.. tip:: User Defined Add-on Path

   You can also create a personal directory containing new add-ons and configure your files path in
   the *File* tab of the *User Preferences*. To create a personal script directory:

   #. Create an empty directory in a location of your choice (e.g. ``my_scripts``).
   #. Add a subdirectory under ``my_scripts`` called ``addons``
      (it *must* have this name for Blender to recognize it).
   #. Open the *File* tab of the *User Preferences*.
   #. Set the *Scripts* in the User Preferences to point to your script directory (e.g. ``my_scripts``).
   #. Save the User Preferences and restart Blender for it to recognize the new add-ons location.

   Now when you install add-ons you can select the *Target Path* option to *User Pref*
   (from the *File* tab).

   Blender will copy newly installed add-ons under the directory selected in your User Preferences.
