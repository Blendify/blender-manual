   Options available to a *Point* constraint.

The objects are linked by a point bearing allowing any kind of rotation around the location of the constraint object,
but no relative translation is permitted. The physics engine will do its best to make sure that the two points
designated by the constraint object on the two constrained objects are coincident.
