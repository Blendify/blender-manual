Simulation
==========

.. glossary::

   Simulation
      A simulation is a process that outputs a description
      representing a static or dynamically evolving state of another (target) system ([Picc15]_ |sect| 4.1).

Models
======

.. glossary::

   Model
      A model is an idealization of a phenomenon or a group of phenomena. 
      Idealization is the simplification by negligibility, isolation to exclude parts outside
      of the tackled system and deliberate distortion [Frig12]_.
      Models can be physical or abstract entities.


Scale models
------------

Models build by down scaling or enlargement. e.g. for architecture or toy car.

Analogical models
-----------------

If certain relevant similarities between the reference and the model. e.g the propagation of water wave and sound.
