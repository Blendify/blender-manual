   :Mode:      Edit Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`3D View Header --> Select Mode`
   :Hotkey:    :kbd:`1`, :kbd:`2`, :kbd:`3`

In Edit Mode there are three different selection modes. You can enter the different modes by selecting one of the three buttons in the header.

   TODO: Selection mode buttons image 

Points
   To select individual points

Strokes
   To select all the points in the selected stroke

Points in between
   To select points that are between other strokes

   TODO: Example image for Points in between selection

Select Menu
===========

   Box/Circle/All/None/Invert Select
   All these options have the same meaning and behavior as in
   :doc:`Object Mode </scene_layout/object/selecting/tools>`


Select Linked
=============

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Edit Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Select --> Linked`
   :Hotkey:    :kbd:`L`, :kbd:`Ctrl-L`

:kbd:`L` (or :kbd:`Ctrl-L` for all) will add to the selection the cursor's nearest control point,
and all the linked ones, i.e. all points belonging to the same stroke.


Select Alternated
=================

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Edit Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Select --> Alternated`
   :Hotkey:    :kbd:`Shift-L`

Selects alternate points in the selected strokes.


Select Grouped
================

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Edit Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Select --> Grouped --> Layer`
               :menuselection:`Select --> Grouped --> Material`
   :Hotkey:    :kbd:`Shift-G`

Layer
   Selects all the points/strokes in the same Layer.
Material
   Selects all the points/strokes that share the same material.

Select First/Last
==========================

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Edit Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Select --> First/Last`,               

These operators will toggle the selection of the first or last point(s) of the stroke(s)
in the object. This is useful to quickly find the start of a stroke.


Select More/Less
================

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Edit Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Select --> More/Less`
   :Hotkey:    :kbd:`Ctrl-NumpadPlus`, :kbd:`Ctrl-NumpadMinus`

Their purpose, based on the currently selected points, is to reduce or enlarge this selection.

More
   For each selected point, select *all* its linked points (i.e. one or two...).
Less
   For each selected point, if *all* points linked to this point are selected, keep this one selected.
   Otherwise, de-select it.

This implies two points:

#. When *all* points of a stroke are selected, nothing will happen
   (as for *Less*, all linked points are always selected, and of course, *More* cannot add any).
   Conversely, the same goes when no points are selected.
#. Second, these tools will never "go outside" of a stroke
   (they will never "jump" to another stroke in the same object).
