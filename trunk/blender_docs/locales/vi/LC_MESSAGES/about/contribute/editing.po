"Before you make any edits that are not simple and plainly justified (for "
"example, moving folders around), you should verify with a manual "
"maintainer that your contribution is along the community's vision for the"

"otherwise possible that, for some reason, your changes will conflict and "
"be rejected or need time-consuming review. For example, another person "
"may be already working on the section you wish to change, the section may"
" be scheduled for deletion or to be updated according to a planned change"
" to Blender."
