"The COLLADAâ„¢ module has been implemented as a flexible tool for exporting"
" and importing ``.dae`` files. A design goal is to provide a set of "
"parameters which should make it possible to export/import Collada files "
"from/to a variety of tools. But please be aware that the Collada module "
"is still a work in progress. So it may be possible that your particular "
"usage scenario is not yet supported."

"follow this option setting, but will rather take it as a hint to use the "

"Collada only records \"joints\" which is mostly similar to Blender's bone"
" heads. But when you import a Collada file then the bone ends are not "
"defined. This does not matter for connected bones where the bone parent "
"only has one child. In that case the parent bone's end location is "
"adjusted to the child's joint position. But especially for unconnected "

msgstr ""

"When the *Fix Leaf Bones* option is enabled then Blender tries to guess "
