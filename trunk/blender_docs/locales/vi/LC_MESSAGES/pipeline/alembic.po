"Alembic is an open computer graphics interchange framework. Alembic "
"distills complex, animated scenes into a non-procedural, application-"
"independent set of baked geometric results. This 'distillation' of scenes"
" into baked geometry is exactly analogous to the distillation of lighting"
" and rendering scenes into rendered image data."

msgid ""
"Alembic is focused on efficiently storing the computed results of complex"
" procedural geometric constructions. It is very specifically **not** "
"concerned with storing the complex dependency graph of procedural tools "
"used to create the computed results. For example, Alembic will "
"efficiently store the animated vertex positions and animated transforms "
"that result from an arbitrarily complex animation and simulation process "
"which could involve enveloping, corrective shapes, volume-preserving "
"simulations, cloth and flesh simulations, and so on. Alembic will not "
"attempt to store a representation of the network of computations (rigs, "
"basically) which are required to produce the final, animated vertex "
"positions and animated transforms."

":abbr:`TL;DR (Too long; didn't read.)`: Alembic can be used to write an "
"animated mesh to disk, and read it back quickly & efficiently. This means"
" that a mesh can be animated with a very CPU-intensive rig, 'baked' to an"
" Alembic file, and loaded into the shot file for shading and lighting "
"with only moderate CPU usage."

"Due to the Open Source nature of the Alembic standard as well as the C++ "
"library implementing that standard, **Blender can be used in a hybrid "
"pipeline**. For example, other software, such as Houdini or Maya, can "
"export files to Alembic, which can then be loaded, shaded, and rendered "
"in Blender. It is also possible to animate characters (or other models) "
"in Blender, export to Alembic, and load those files into other software "
"for further processing."

"These options control the sub-frame sampling of animations. Transform "
"Samples sets the number of times per frame at which animated "
"transformations are sampled and written to Alembic. Geometry Samples sets"
" the same, but then for animated geometry. Shutter Open & Close define "
"the interval [open, close] over which those samples are taken. The valid "
"range is -1 to 1, where -1 indicates the previous frame, 0 indicates the "
"current frame, and 1 indicates the next frame. For example, if "
"information for detailed mesh motion blur is desired, some subframes "
"around the current frame can be written to Alembic by using a sample "
"count of 5, Shutter Open at -0.25 and Shutter Close at 0.25. This mimics "
"a \"180 degree\" shutter, opening 90 degrees before the frame and closing"
" 90 degrees after the frame."
