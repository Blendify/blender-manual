"There are options to save a backup of your files like *Auto Save* that "
"saves your file automatically over time, and *Save on Quit*, which saves "
"your blend-file automatically when you exit Blender. In addition to these"
" functions being enabled by default, the *Save on Quit* functionality "
"cannot be disabled."

"exists for each project, i.e. Blender does not keep older versions. "
"Hence, you will not be able to go back more than a few minutes with this "
"tool."
