"The *Action Editor* is where you can define and control :doc:`actions "
"</animation/actions>`. It enables you to view and edit the F-Curve data-"
"blocks you defined as Actions in the *F-Curve Editor*. So it takes place "
"somewhere in between the low-level :doc:`F-Curves "
"</editors/graph_editor/introduction>`, and the high-level :doc:`NLA "
"editor </editors/nla/index>`."

"It gives you a slightly simplified view of the F-Curve data-blocks "
"(somewhat similar to F-Curve drawn without handles). The editor can list "
"all Action data-blocks of an object at once."

msgid ""
"Each Action data-block forms a top-level channel (see below). Note that "
"an object can have several *Constraint* (one per animated constraint) and"
" *Pose* (for armatures, one per animated bone) F-Curve data-blocks, and "
"hence an action can have several of these channels."
