"The curve type used for creating mask splines is almost a Bézier curve, "
"but with some differences. Smooth edges of the mask are defined by "
"feathering. The curve needed to support feathering in a way that stuck to"
" the curve as you edited it, for ease of editing an animation. These are "
"called S-Curves."

"Besides the handles, every control point also has points that define the "
"feather between the current point and the next point on the spline. Each "
"feather point is stored in UW space, where U means position across spline"
" segment, and W (weight) means distance between main spline and feather "
"points."

"This allows for deforming the main spline in almost any way, and the "
"feather will be updated automatically to reflect that change."

"For example if there is just rotation of the spline, feather would stay "
"completely unchanged. If one point's feather is moved, the other feathers"
" will be automatically stretched uniformly along that segment and the "
"overall shape will be almost the same as artists would want it to be."
