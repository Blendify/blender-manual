"Masks can be created in the *UV/Image* and *Movie Clip* editors, by "
"changing the mode to *Mask* in the header. This will add various tools "
"and properties to the editor panels, while hiding others that are not "
"needed for interacting with masks."

"Masks have many purposes. They can be used in a motion tracking workflow "
"to mask out, or influence a particular object in the footage. They can be"
" used for manual rotoscoping to pull a particular object out of the "
"footage, or as a rough matte for green-screen keying. Masks are "
"independent from a particular image of movie clip, and so they can just "
"as well be used for creating motion graphics or other effects in the "
"compositor."
