"Motion Tracking is used to track the motion of objects and/or a "
"background scene and, through the compositor, to apply this tracking data"
" to 3D objects (or just one), which have either been created in Blender "
"or imported into the application. Blender's motion tracker supports a "
"couple of very powerful tools for 2D tracking and 3D motion tracking, "
"including camera tracking and object tracking, as well as some special "
"features like the plane track for compositing. Tracks can also be used to"
" move and deform masks for rotoscoping in the Mask Editor, which is "
"available as a special mode in the Movie Clip Editor."

"In Tracking Mode there are three different views available. You can "
"toggle between view modes using the View menu, which is located in the "
"header. When you selected a view in the whole area of the Movie Clip "
"editor will change. Hence, to display a curve or dope sheet view, the "
"editor must be split into two, with one switched to the curve or dope "
"sheet view."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All cameras record distorted video. Nothing can be done about this "
"because of the manner in which optical lenses work. For accurate camera "
"motion, the exact value of the focal length and the \"strength\" of "
"distortion are needed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/editors/movie_clip_editor/tracking/introduction.rst:32
msgid ""
"Currently, focal length can be automatically obtained only from the "
"camera's settings or from the EXIF information. There are some tools "
"which can help to find approximate values to compensate for distortion. "
"There are also fully manual tools where you can use a grid which is "
"getting affected by distortion model and deformed cells defines straight "
"lines in the footage."

msgid ""
"You can also use the Grease pencil for this -- just draw a line which "
"should be straight on the footage using poly line brush and adjust the "
"distortion values to make the Grease pencil match lines on the footage."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/editors/movie_clip_editor/tracking/introduction.rst:41
msgid ""
"To calibrate your camera more accurately, use the Grid calibration tool "
"from OpenCV. OpenCV is using the same distortion model, so it should not "
"be a problem."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Blender not only supports the solving of camera motion, including tripod "
"shots, but also the solving of object motion in relation to the motion of"
" the camera. In addition to that there is the Plane Track, which solves "
"the motion of all markers on one plane."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/editors/movie_clip_editor/tracking/introduction.rst:52
msgid ""
"There are also plans to add more tools in the future, for example more "
"automatic tracking and solving, multi-camera solving and constrained "
"solutions."

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/editors/movie_clip_editor/tracking/introduction.rst:59
msgid ""
"After solve, you need to orient the real scene in the 3D scene for more "
"convenient compositing. There are tools to define the floor, the scene "
"origin, and the X/Y axes to perform scene orientation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sometimes, the video footage includes spurious jumps and tilting "
"movements, like e.g. when using a hand-held camera. Based on some tracked"
" image elements, the "
":doc:`/editors/movie_clip_editor/tracking/clip/properties/stabilization/index`"
" is able to detect and compensate such movements to improve the quality "
"of the final result."
