"A proxy is a smaller image (faster to load) that stands in for the main "
"image. When you rebuild proxies Blender computes small images (like "
"thumbnails) for the big images and may take some time. After computing "
"them, though, editing functions like scrubbing and scrolling is much "
"faster but gives a low-res result. Make sure to disable proxies before "
"final rendering."

"When you are working with footage directly copied from a camera without "

" Blender to calculate the position of a needed frame in the stream works "
"inaccurately and can give errant result. There are two possible ways to "
"avoid this:"
