"Speed Control time-warps the strip, making it play faster or slower than "
"it normally would. A *Global Speed* less than 1.0 makes the strip play "
"slower; greater than 1. 0 makes it play faster. Playing faster means that"
" some frames are skipped, and the strip will run out of frames before the"
" end frame. When the strip runs out of frames to display, it will just "
"keep repeating the last one; action will appear to freeze. To avoid this,"
" position the next strip under the original at a point where you want the"
" motion to continue."

msgid ""
"You can use the speed control to change the frame rate in frames per "
"second (fps) of a video. If you are rendering your video to a sequence "
"set, you can effectively increase or decrease the number of individual "
"image files created, by using a Global Speed value less than or greater "
"than one, respectively. For example, if you captured a five-minute video "
"at 30 fps and wanted to transfer that to film, which runs at 24 fps, you "
"would enter a Global Speed of 30/24, or 1.25 (and Enable Frame Blending "
"to give that film blur feel). Instead of producing ``5 × 60 × 30 = 9000``"
" frames, Blender would produce ``9000 / 1.25 = 7200 = 5 × 60 × 24`` "
"frames. In this case, you set a *start* = 1 and *end* = 7200, set your "
"Format output to ``jpeg`` 30fps, and image files ``0001.jpg`` through "
"``7200.jpg`` would be rendered out, but those images cover the entire "
"9000 frames. The image file ``7200.jpg`` is the same a frame 9000. When "
"you read those images back into your film blend-file at 24 fps, the strip"
" will last exactly 5 minutes."
