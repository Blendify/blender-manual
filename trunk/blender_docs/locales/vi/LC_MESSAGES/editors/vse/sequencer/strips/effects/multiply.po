"The *Multiply* effect multiplies two colors. Blender uses values between "
"(0.0 to 1.0) for the colors, this operation does not have to be "
"normalized, the multiplication of two terms between (0.0 to 1.0) always "
"gives a result between (0.0 to 1.0)."

"(with the \"traditional\" representation of three bytes, like RGB(124, "
"255, 56), the multiplications give far too high results, like RGB(7316, "
"46410, 1848), that have to be, normalized (brought back) by dividing them"
" by 256 to fit in the range of (0 to 255) ...)."

"For example, if you have a brown pixel RGB(0.50, 0.29, 0.05), and you "
"multiply it with a cyan filter (uniform color RGB(0.0, 1.0, 1.0)), you "
"will get a color RGB(0.0, 0.29, 0.5). Visually, the result is to zero the"
" reds and bring up (by \"symmetry\" -- the real values remain unchanged!)"
" the blues and greens. Physically, it is the same effect as shining a "
"cyan light onto a chocolate bar. Emotionally, vegetation becomes more "
"lush, water becomes more Caribbean and inviting, skies become friendlier."

"This effect reduces the global luminosity of the picture (the result will"
" always be smaller than the smallest operand). If one of the image is all"
" white, the result is the other picture; if one of the image is all "
"black, the result is all black!"
