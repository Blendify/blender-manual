"Using the alpha (transparency channel), this effect composites a result "
"based on transparent areas of the dominant image. If you use a Scene "
"strip, the areas of the image where there is not anything solid are "
"transparent; they have an alpha value of 0. If you use a movie strip, "
"that movie has an alpha value of 1 (completely opaque)."

"So, you can use the *Alpha Over* / *Alpha Under* effect to composite the "
"CGI Scene on top of your movie. The result is your model doing whatever "
"as if it was part of the movie. The :menuselection:`Edit Strip --> "
"Opacity` controls how much the foreground is mixed over the background, "
"fading in the foreground on top of the background. The colors of "
"transparent foreground image areas is ignored and does not change the "
"color of the background."

"With *Alpha Over*, the strips are layered up in the order selected; the "
"first strip selected is the background, and the second one goes *over* "
"the first one selected. The *Opacity* controls the transparency of the "
"*foreground*, i.e. *Opacity* of 0.0; will only show the background, and "
"an *Opacity* of 1.0 will completely override the background with the "
"foreground (except in the transparent areas of this one, of course!)"

"By clicking the *Premultiply Alpha* button in the properties panel of the"
" foreground strip, the alpha values of the two strips are not multiplied "
"or added together. Use this effect when adding a foreground strip that "
"has a variable alpha channel (some opaque areas, some transparent, some "
"in between) over a strip that has a flat opaque (alpha=1.0 or greater) "
"channel. If you notice a glow around your foreground objects, or strange "
"transparent areas of your foreground object when using *Alpha Over*, "
"enable *Premultiply*."

"With *Alpha Under*, this is the contrary: The first strip selected is the"
" foreground, and the second one, the background. Moreover, the *Opacity* "
"controls the transparency of the *background*, i.e. an *Opacity* of 0.0; "
"will only show the foreground (the background is completely transparent),"
" and an *Opacity* of 1.0 will give the same results as with *Alpha Over*."

"The Alpha Over Drop effect is much like the Cross, but puts preference to"
" the top or second image, giving more of a gradual overlay effect than a "
"blend like the Cross does. Of course, all of the Alpha effects respect "
"the alpha (transparency) channel, whereas Cross does not."

"The degree of Alpha applied, and thus color mixing, can be controlled by "
