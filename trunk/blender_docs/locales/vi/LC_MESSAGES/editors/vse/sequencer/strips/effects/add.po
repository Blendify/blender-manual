"The Add Effect adds the colors of two strips together, Use this effect "
"with a base image strip, and a modifier strip. The modifier strip is "
"either a solid color or a black-and-white mask, or another image "
"entirely."

"You can use this effect to increase the brightness of an image, or if you"
" use a BW mask, selectively increase the brightness of certain areas of "
"the image. The Mix node, in Add mode, does exactly the same thing as the "
"Add SFX strip here, and is controlled the same way by feeding the Factor "
"input."

"The example to the right shows what happens when you add gray to an "
"image. The image gets bright because we are adding gray (R:0.5, G:0.5, "
"B:0.5) to say, a blue color (R:0.1, G:0.1, B:0.5) resulting in (R:0.6, "
"G:0.6, B:1.0) which retains the original hue (relationship between the "
"colors) but is much brighter (has a higher value). When applied to the "
"whole image like this, the whole image seems to flash."
