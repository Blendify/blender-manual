"A proxy is a lower resolution version (faster to load) that stands in for"
" the main image or video. When you Rebuild proxy Blender computes small "
"images (like thumbnails) for the big images and may take some time. After"
" computing them, though, editing functions like scrubbing and scrolling "
"and compositing functions like cross using these proxies is much faster "
"but gives a low-res result. Disable proxies before final rendering."
