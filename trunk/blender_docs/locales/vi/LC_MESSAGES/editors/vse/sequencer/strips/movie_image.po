msgid ""
"Dealing with different sized images and different sized outputs is "
"tricky. If you have a mis-match between the size of the input image and "
"the render output size, the VSE will try to auto-scale the image to fit "
"it entirely in the output. This may result in clipping. If you do not "
"want that, use *Crop* and/or *Offset* in the Input panel to move and "
"select a region of the image within the output. When you use *Crop* or "
"*Offset*, the auto-scaling will be disabled and you can manually re-scale"
" by adding the Transform effect."

"Image sequences can use placeholder files. This works by enabling *Use "
"placeholders* checkbox when adding an image strip. The option detects the"
" frame range of opened images using Blender's frame naming scheme "
"(filename + frame number + .extension) and makes an image sequence with "
"all files in between even if they are missing. This allows you to render "
"an image sequence with a few frames missing and still the image strip "
"will have the correct range to account for the missing frames displayed "
"as black. When the missing frames are rendered or placed in the same "
"folder, you can refresh the Sequencer and get the missing frames in the "
"strip. The option is also available when using the *Change Data/File* "
"operator and allows you to add more images to the range."

"If you scroll up the workspace, you will see an information channel (at "

"active strip. The example above shows a color strip from frames 1 to 25, "
"then a ``mov`` file, and then an image strip. The info channel shows "
"handy information about the image strip, whose name has been scrunched in"
" the strip display, but is clearly spelled out in the information strip."
