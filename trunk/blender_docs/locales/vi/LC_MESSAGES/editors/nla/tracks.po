"can help organize strips. But it also layers motion much like an image "

msgid ""
"When creating a new action, if the existing action only has a single user"

"stack. Action Stashing should prevent most cases actions getting lost."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/editors/nla/tracks.rst:69
msgid ""
"The action \"stashing\" method works by storing otherwise unused/dormant "
"actions in the NLA stack as strips in special muted NLA Tracks. This way,"
" Blender can \"know\" that the action is related to a particular data-"
"block (i.e. to a specific object, or to a specific material/lamp/etc.) "
"and that you still want to keep it for later use."

"Also, note that since these are NLA strips, you can reuse these as normal"
" NLA strips simply by un-muting (and renaming) the NLA track they live "
"in. You may also want to move it above all the other stashed-action "
"tracks."

"It is sometimes possible to end up with a lot of data-blocks which have "
"old and unused Animation Data containers still attached. This most "
"commonly happens when doing motion graphics work (i.e. when some linked-"
"in objects may have previously been used to develop a set of reusable "
"assets), and is particularly distracting in the NLA Editor."
