"Conceptually, grouping nodes allows you to specify a *set* of nodes that "
"you can treat as though it were \"just one node\". Node groups are "
"similar to functions in programming. You can then reuse them inside, "
"which are then called \"NodeGroups\", or in other blend-file(s), when "
"appending called \"NodeTrees\"."

"As an example: If you have created a material that you would like to use "
"with different inputs e.g. diffuse color: red plastic, green plastic. You"
" could create different materials with *Make Single User* for each "
"different color with a copy of the tree part describing the plastic "
"material. If you like to edit the material you would need to redo the "
"edit on all materials. A better method of reuse is to create node groups,"
" exposing only the variable inputs (e.g. diffuse color)."

" A node group will have a green title bar. All of the selected nodes will"

"group is \"NodeGroup\", \"NodeGroup.001\" etc. There is a name field in "
"the node group you can click into to change the name of the group. Change"
" the name of the node group to something meaningful. When appending node "
"groups from one blend-file to another, Blender does not make a "
"distinction between material node groups or composite node groups, so it "
"is recommended to use some naming convention that will allow you to "
"easily distinguish between the two types."
