"*Modes* are a Blender-level object-oriented feature, which means that "
"whole Blender application is always in a singular mode, and that the "
"available modes vary depending on the selected active object's type -- "
"most of them only enable the default *Object Mode* (like cameras, lamps, "
"etc.). Each mode is designed to edit an aspect of the selected object. "
