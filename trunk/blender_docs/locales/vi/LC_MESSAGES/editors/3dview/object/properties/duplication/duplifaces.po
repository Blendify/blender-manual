"The location, orientation, and scale of the duplicated child(ren) matches"

"The positioning of the duplicated geometry relative to the face is "
"dependent upon the position of the child objects relative to the "
"duplicator's origin. This can lead to some visual artifacts in the editor"
" as the geometry of the original objects overlaps or intersects with the "
"duplicates. One workaround is to move the origin of the duplicator mesh "
"off of the plane of the faces."

"If the geometry of the children is not symmetrical then the orientation "
"of the face (as determined by the order of its vertices) could matter. As"
" of 2.70 Blender does not have tools which allow you to adjust the "
"ordering of the vertices on a face."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/editors/3dview/object/properties/duplication/duplifaces.rst:105
msgid ""
"However, there is a workflow that lets you control for this. Make a "
"single square and enable the Duplication/Faces so you can see the "
"duplicated geometry in your editor. If the orientation is not what you "
"want, rotate the face until it is how you want. Typically you want to do "
"the rotation in Edit Mode, not Object Mode, but this is not a hard rule."

"Once you have the orientation correct, Duplicate the face and move the "

"Doubles button in the Tools panel."
