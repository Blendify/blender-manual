"3D scenes often become exponentially more confusing as they grow more "

"affect nearby objects. For this and other reasons below, objects can be "
"placed into one or more \"layers\". Using object layers, you can:"

"Armatures can also become very complex, with different types of bones, "
"controllers, solvers, custom shapes, and so on. Since armatures are "
"usually located close together, this can quickly become cluttered. "
"Therefore, Blender also provides layers just for armatures. Armature "
"layers are very similar to object layers, in that you can divide up an "
"armature (rig) across layers and only display those layers you wish to "
