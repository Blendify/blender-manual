"Mirroring an Object or Mesh selection will create a reversed version of "
"the selection. The position of the mirrored version of the selection is "
"determined by the :doc:`Pivot Point "
"</editors/3dview/object/editing/transform/control/pivot_point/index>`. A "
"common use of mirroring is to model half an object, duplicate it and then"
" use the mirror transform to create a reversed version to complete the "
"model."

"To mirror a selection along a particular global axis press: "
":kbd:`Ctrl-M`, followed by :kbd:`X`, :kbd:`Y` or :kbd:`Z`. The image "

"In Mesh mode, you can mirror the selection on the currently selected "
":doc:`Transform Orientations "
"</editors/3dview/object/editing/transform/control/orientations>` by "
"pressing the appropriate axis key a second time. For example, if the "
"Transform Orientation is set to *Normal*, pressing: :kbd:`Ctrl-M`, "
"followed by :kbd:`X` and then :kbd:`X` again will mirror the selection "
"along the X axis of the *Normal Orientation*."
