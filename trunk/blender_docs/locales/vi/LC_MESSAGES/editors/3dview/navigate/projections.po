"Our eye is used to perspective viewing because distant objects appear "
"smaller. Orthographic projection often seems a bit odd at first, because "
"objects stay the same size regardless of their distance. It is like "
"viewing the scene from an infinitely distant point. Nevertheless, "
"orthographic viewing is very useful (it is the default in Blender and "
"most other 3D applications), because it provides a more \"technical\" "
"insight into the scene, making it easier to draw and judge proportions."

"To change the projection for a 3D View, choose the :menuselection:`View "
"--> Orthographic` or the :menuselection:`View --> Perspective` menu "
"entry. The :kbd:`Numpad5` shortcut toggles between the two modes. "
"Changing the projection for a 3D View does not affect the way the scene "
"will be rendered. Rendering is in perspective by default. If you need to "
"create an orthographic rendering, select the camera, go to the Camera tab"
" and press the *Orthographic* button in the *Lens* panel."
