"The *Region/Volume clipping* image shows an example of using the clipping"
" tool with a cube. Start by activating the tool with :kbd:`Alt-B` (upper "
"left of the image). This will generate a dashed cross-hair cursor. Click "
"with the :kbd:`LMB` and drag out a rectangular region shown in the upper "
"right. Now a region is defined and clipping is applied against that "
"region in 3D space. Notice that part of the cube is now invisible or "
"clipped. Use the :kbd:`MMB` to rotate the view and you will see that only"
" what is inside the pyramidal volume is visible. All the editing tools "
"still function as normal but only within the pyramidal clipping volume."
