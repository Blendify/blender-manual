"For many cases, using the Unwrap calculations of Cube, Cylinder, Sphere, "
"or best fit will produce a good UV layout. However, for more complex "
"meshes, especially those with lots of indentations, you may want to "
"define a *seam* to limit and guide any of the unwrapping processes "
"discussed above."

"Just like in sewing, a seam is where the ends of the image/cloth are sewn"
" together. In unwrapping, the mesh is unwrapped at the seams. Think of "
"this method as peeling an orange or skinning an animal. You make a series"
" of cuts in the skin, then peel it off. You could then flatten it out, "
"applying some amount of stretching. These cuts are the same as seams."

"When using this method, you need to be aware of how much stretching there"
" is. The more seams there are, the less stretching there is, but this is "
"often an issue for the texturing process. It is a good idea to have as "
"few seams as possible while having the least amount of stretching. Try to"
" hide seams where they will not be seen. In productions where 3D paint is"
" used, this becomes less of an issue, as projection painting can easily "
"deal with seams, as opposed to 2D texturing, where it is difficult to "
"match the edges of different UV islands."

"In the example to the right, the back-most edge of the cylinder was "

"Just as there are many ways to skin a cat, there are many ways to go "
"about deciding where seams should go. In general though, you should think"
" as if you were holding the object in one hand, and a pair of sharp "
"scissors in the other, and you want to cut it apart and spread it on the "
"table with as little tearing as possible. Note that we seamed the outside"
" edges of her ears, to separate the front from the back. Her eyes are "
"disconnected sub-meshes, so they are automatically unwrapped by "
"themselves. A seam runs along the back of her head vertically, so that "
"each side of her head is flattened out."

#: ../../manual/editors/uv_image/uv/editing/unwrapping/seams.rst:88
msgid ""
"Another use for seams is to limit the faces unwrapped. For example, when "
"texturing a head, you do not really need to texture the scalp on the top "
"and back of the head since it will be covered in hair. So define a seam "
"at the hairline. Then, when you select a frontal face, and then select "
"linked faces before unwrapping, the select will only go up to the "
"hairline seam, and the scalp will not be unwrapped."

"When unwrapping anything that is bilateral, like a head or a body, seam "
"it along the mirror axis. For example, cleave a head or a whole body "
"right down the middle in front view. When you unwrap, you will be able to"
" overlay both halves onto the same :term:`texture space`, so that the "
"image pixels for the right hand will be shared with the left; the right "
"side of the face will match the left, etc."
