"Sooner or later, you may want to use an image texture on your model. If "
"you are using an external application, you need to know where on the mesh"
" you are painting. You may also need to test your UV mapping with a test "
"image. This section covers how to export an outline of your UV map, and "
"how to load images into the UV/Image editor."

"The UV/Image Editor allows you to map textures directly to the mesh "
"faces. The 3D View editor shows you the object being textured. If you set"
" this editor into Textured viewport shading, you will immediately see any"
" changes made in the UV/Image and this editor, and vice versa."

"You can edit and load images, and even play a game in the Blender Game "
"Engine with UV textures for characters and object, without a material, "
"and still see them in the 3D View. This is because no real rendering is "
"taking place; it is all just viewport shading. If you were to apply an "
"image to UVs then render, the texture would not show up by default."

"You can perform UV texturing on a mesh within Blender without assigning a"
