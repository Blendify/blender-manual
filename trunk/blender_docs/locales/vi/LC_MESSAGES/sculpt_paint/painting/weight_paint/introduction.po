"Vertex Groups can potentially have a very large number of associated "
"vertices and thus a large number of weights (one weight per assigned "
"vertex). *Weight Painting* is a method to maintain large amounts of "
"weight information in a very intuitive way."

"It is primarily used for rigging meshes, where the vertex groups are used"
" to define the relative bone influences on the mesh. But we use it also "
"for controlling particle emission, hair density, many modifiers, shape "
"keys, etc."

"You enter *Weight Paint Mode* from the Mode Menu :kbd:`Ctrl-Tab`. The "
"selected Mesh Object is displayed slightly shaded with a rainbow color "
"spectrum. The color visualizes the weights associated to each vertex in "
"the active Vertex Group. By default *blue* means unweighted and *red* "
"means fully weighted."

"You assign weights to the vertices of the Object by painting on it with "
"weight brushes. Starting to paint on a mesh automatically adds weights to"
" the active Vertex Group (a new Vertex Group is created if needed)."

"Weights are visualized by a gradient using a cold/hot color system, such "
"that areas of low value (with weights close to 0.0) are drawn in blue "
"(cold) and areas of high value (with weights close to 1.0) are drawn in "
"red (hot). And all in-between values are drawn in rainbow colors (blue, "
"green, yellow, orange, red)."

"In addition to the above described color code, Blender has a special "
"visual notation (as an option) for unreferenced vertices: They are drawn "
"in black. Thus you can see the referenced areas (drawn in cold/hot "
"colors) and the unreferenced areas (in black) at the same time. This is "
"most practicable when you look for weighting errors. See "
":doc:`/sculpt_paint/painting/weight_paint/options`."
