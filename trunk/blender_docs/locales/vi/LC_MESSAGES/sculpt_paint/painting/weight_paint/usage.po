"This is one of the main uses of weight painting. When a bone moves, "
"vertices around the joint should move as well, but just a little, to "
"mimic the stretching of the skin around the joint. Use a \"light\" weight"
" (10 - 40%) paint on the vertices around the joint so that they move a "
"little when the bone rotates. While there are ways to automatically "
"assign weights to an armature (see the :doc:`Armature section "
"</rigging/index>`), you can do this manually. To do this from scratch, "
"refer to the process below. To modify automatically assigned weights, "
"jump into the middle of the process where noted:"

" \"conserves\" the total indicated number of particles, adjusting the "
"distributions so that the proper weights are achieved while using the "
"actual number of particles called for. Use this to make portions of your "
"mesh hairier than others by weight painting a vertex group, and then "
"calling out the name of the vertex group in the :doc:`Vertex Groups "
