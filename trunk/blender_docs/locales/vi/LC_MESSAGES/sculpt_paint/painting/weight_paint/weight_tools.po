"You may notice that the Operator panel stays available after the weight "

"Operator that has its own Operator panel. This can lead to confusion when"
" you use Transfer weights repeatedly after you changed your vertex "
"groups. If you then use the still-visible Operator panel, then Blender "
"will reset your work to its state right before you initially called the "
"*Transfer Weights* tool."
