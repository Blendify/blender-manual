"Dynamic topology (aka dyntopo) is a dynamic tessellation sculpting "
"method, adds and removes details on-the-fly, whereas regular sculpting "
"only affects the shape of a mesh."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/adaptive.rst:19
msgid ""
"This makes it possible to sculpt complex shapes out of a simple mesh, "
"rather than just adding details onto a modeled base mesh."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/adaptive.rst:22
msgid ""
"Dyntopo can be toggled with the checkbox in the header or with "
":kbd:`Ctrl-D`. With dynamic topology active, most brushes will subdivide "
"the mesh during the stroke."

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/adaptive.rst:29
msgid ""
"This method uses a detail size based on the number of pixels, and in turn"

msgid "Constant Detail"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/adaptive.rst:32

"To keep detail uniform across the entire object, Constant Detail can be "

"Giving more control over the topology, with this method you can create "
"topology based on the brush size. You can increase and lower topology by "
"simply resizing the brush itself. The detail size is based the size of "
"the brush itself, where 100% will create topology the size of the brush "
"ring itself."

"Uses direction orientation to symmetrize. Since Dyntopo adds details "

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/adaptive.rst:79
msgid ""
"The Multiresolution Modifier is needed to sculpt. The modifier will "
"subdivide the mesh. The more subdivision the more computing will be "
"needed. With the Blender stack non-destructive data, multi-resolution "
"sculpting will help when you have a clean topology base mesh."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/adaptive.rst:83
msgid ""
"When sculpting with multiple resolutions you have the ability to sculpt "
"in different levels of subdivision, this mean you can sculpt some details"
" in subdivision level 1 and add more details in subdivision 2 and go back"
" to subdivision 1 correct some mistakes. While this workflow is often "
"used, the Multiresolution Modifier has some limitations. You may end up "
"with some mesh distortions. As an advice, add as most details as possible"
" before adding more subdivisions. Clay brush, SculptDraw work better with"
" multi-resolution sculpting to sculpt secondary forms."
