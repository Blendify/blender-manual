"*Sculpt Mode* is similar to *Edit Mode* in that it is used to alter the "
"shape of a model, but Sculpt Mode uses a very different workflow: instead"
" of dealing with individual elements (vertices, edges, and faces), an "
"area of the model is altered using a brush. In other words, instead of "
"selecting a group of vertices, Sculpt Mode manipulates geometry in the "
"brush region of influence."

"Sculpt mode is selected from the mode menu of the *3D View* header. Once "
"sculpt mode is activated, the Tool Shelf of the *3D View* will change to "
"sculpt mode specific panels. The panels will be *Brush*, *Texture*, "
"*Tool*, *Symmetry*, *Stroke*, *Curve*, *Appearance*, and *Options*. A red"
" circle will appear and follow the location of the cursor in the 3D View."
