"Blender uses a novel screen-splitting approach to arrange areas. The idea"
" is that you split up that big application window into any number of "
"smaller (but still rectangular) non-overlapping areas. That way, each "
"area is always fully visible, and it is very easy to work in one area and"
" hop over to work in another."
