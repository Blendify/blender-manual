"The most elementary part of a mesh is the vertex which is a single point "
"or position in 3D space. The vertices (the plural form of vertex) are "
"stored in an array of coordinates."

"It is usually invisible in rendering and in *Object Mode*. Do not mistake"
" the :doc:`Origin Point </editors/3dview/object/origin>` of an object for"
" a vertex. It looks similar, but it is bigger and you cannot select it."

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/structure.rst:35
msgid ""
"An edge always connects two vertices by a straight line. The edges are "
"the \"wires\" you see when you look at a mesh in wireframe view. They are"
" usually invisible on the rendered image. They are used to construct "
"faces."

msgid "Faces"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/structure.rst:43
msgid ""
"Faces are used to build the actual surface of the object. They are what "
"you see when you render the mesh. If this area does not contain a face, "
"it will simply be transparent or non-existent in the rendered image."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/structure.rst:48
msgid ""
"A face is defined as the area between either three (triangles), four "
"(quadrangles) or more (n-gons) vertices, with an edge on every side. The "
"faces are often abbreviated to *tris, quads & n-gons*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/structure.rst:51
msgid ""
"Triangles are always flat and therefore easy to calculate. On the other "
"hand, quadrangles \"deform well\" and are therefore preferred for "
"animation and subdivision modeling."

"While you could build a cube with triangular faces, it would just look "
"more confusing in *Edit Mode*."

"*Edge* and *face* loops are sets of faces or edges that form continuous "
"\"loops\" as shown in Fig. :ref:`fig-mesh-topo-loop`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/structure.rst:72
msgid ""
"Note that loops (2 and 4) do not go around the whole model. Loops stop at"
" so-called poles because there is no unique way to continue a loop from a"
" pole. Poles are vertices that are connected to either three, five, or "
"more edges. Accordingly, vertices connected to exactly one, two or four "
"edges are not poles."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/structure.rst:77
msgid ""
"In the image above, loops that do not end in poles are cyclic (1 and 3). "
"They start and end at the same vertex and divide the model into two "
"partitions. Loops can be a quick and powerful tool to work with specific,"
" continuous regions of a mesh and are a prerequisite for organic "
"character animation. For a detailed description of how to work with loops"
" in Blender, see: :doc:`Advanced Selection "
"</modeling/meshes/selecting/advanced>`."

msgid "Edge Loops"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/structure.rst:90
msgid ""
"Loops (1 and 2) in Fig. :ref:`fig-mesh-topo-loop` are edge loops. They "
"connect vertices so that each one on the loop has exactly two neighbors "
"that are not on the loop and placed on both sides of the loop (except the"
" start and end vertex in case of poles)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/structure.rst:94
msgid ""
"Edge loops are an important concept especially in organic (subsurface) "
"modeling and character animation. When used correctly, they allow you to "
"build models with relatively few vertices that look very natural when "
"used as subdivision surfaces and deform very well in animation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/structure.rst:99
msgid ""
"Take Fig. :ref:`fig-mesh-topo-loop` in organic modeling as an example: "
"the edge loops follow the natural contours and deformation lines of the "
"skin and the underlying muscles and are more dense in areas that deform "
"more when the character moves, for example at the shoulders or knees."

msgid "Face Loops"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/structure.rst:110
msgid ""
"These are a logical extension of edge loops in that they consist of the "
"faces between two edge loops, as shown in loops (3 and 4) in Fig. :ref"
":`fig-mesh-topo-loop`. Note that for non-circular loops (4) the faces "
"containing the poles are not included in a face loop."
