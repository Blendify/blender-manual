"Shearing is a form of movement where parallel surfaces move past one "
"another. During this transform, movement of the selected elements will "
"occur along the horizontal axis of the current view. The axis location "
"will be defined by the :doc:`Pivot Point "
"</editors/3dview/object/editing/transform/control/pivot_point/index>`. "
"Everything that is \"above\" this axis will move (Shear) in the same "
"direction as your mouse pointer (but always parallel to the horizontal "
"axis). Everything that is \"below\" the horizontal axis will move in the "
"opposite direction."

"Select the elements you want to operate on and activate the *Shear* "
"transform tool. The *Shear* tool can be invoked from the "
":menuselection:`Object/Mesh/Curve/Surface --> Transform --> Shear` menu "
"or by pressing :kbd:`Shift-Ctrl-Alt-S`. The amount of movement given to "
"the selection can be determined interactively by moving the mouse or by "
"typing a number. Pressing :kbd:`Return` will confirm the transformation. "
"The confirmed transformation can be further edited by pressing :kbd:`F6` "
"or by going into the Tool Shelf and altering the Offset slider provided "
"that no other actions take place between the *Shear* transform "
"confirmation and accessing the slider."

"Note that the result of the *Shear* transform is also dependent on the "

"See below for the result of using *Shear* on a number of different "
"elements."

"The three frames of the image above show the effects of shearing on the "
"selected vertices when the pivot point is altered. In middle frame, the "
":doc:`Pivot Point "
"</editors/3dview/object/editing/transform/control/pivot_point/index>` is "
"set to *Median Point* and the mouse was moved to the left during the "
"transform. In right frame, the *Pivot Point* is set to the 3D cursor "
"which is located above the mesh. When the mouse is moved to the left "
"during a *Shear* transform, the selected vertices are moved to the right "

"The magnitude of the *Shear* transform applied to the selected elements "

"that, the magnitude of the transform is proportional to the distance from"

"the upper ones."
