"The *Symmetrize* tool is a quick way to make a mesh symmetrical. "
"*Symmetrize* works by cutting the mesh at the pivot point of the object, "
"and mirroring over the geometry in the specified axis, and merges the two"
" halves together (if they are connected). Also the mesh data is copied "
"from one side to the other: e.g. UVs, vertex colors, vertex weights."
