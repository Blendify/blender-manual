"Although the process is quite intuitive, the principles behind *Extrude* "

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/editing/duplicating/extrude.rst:73
msgid ""
"First, the algorithm determines the outside edge loop of the extrude; "
"that is, which among the selected edges will be changed into faces. By "
"default (see below), the algorithm considers edges belonging to two or "
"more selected faces as internal, and hence not part of the loop."

msgid "The edges in the edge loop are then changed into faces."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/editing/duplicating/extrude.rst:77
msgid ""
"If the edges in the edge loop belong to only one face in the complete "
"mesh, then all of the selected faces are duplicated and linked to the "
"newly created faces. For example, rectangles will result in "
"parallelepipeds during this stage."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/editing/duplicating/extrude.rst:80
msgid ""
"In other cases, the selected faces are linked to the newly created faces "
"but not duplicated. This prevents undesired faces from being retained "
"\"inside\" the resulting mesh. This distinction is extremely important "
"since it ensures the construction of consistently coherent, closed "
"volumes at all times when using *Extrude*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/editing/duplicating/extrude.rst:84
msgid ""
"When extruding completely closed volumes (like e.g. a cube with all its "
"six faces), extrusion results merely in a duplication, as the volume is "
"duplicated, without any link to the original one."
msgstr ""

"*Extrude Individual* allows you to extrude a selection of multiple faces "
"as individuals, instead of as a region. The faces are extruded along "
