"Select the elements you want to operate on and activate the *To Sphere* "
"transform tool. The *To Sphere* tool can be invoked from the "
":menuselection:`Mesh --> Transform --> To Sphere` menu or by pressing "
":kbd:`Shift-Alt-S`. The amount of sphericity given to the selection can "
"be determined interactively by moving the mouse or by typing a number "
"between 0 and 1. Pressing :kbd:`Return` will confirm the transformation. "
"The confirmed transformation can be further edited by pressing :kbd:`F6` "
"or by going into the *Tool Shelf* and altering the *Factor* slider "
"provided that no other actions take place between the *To Sphere* "
"transform confirmation and accessing the slider."
