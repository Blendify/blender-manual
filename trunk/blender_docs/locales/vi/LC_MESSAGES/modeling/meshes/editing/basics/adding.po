"The most basic element, a vertex, can be added with a :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` "
"click when no other vertices are selected. Because the camera space "
"(computer screen) is two-dimensional, Blender cannot determine all three "
"vertex coordinates from a single mouse click, so the new vertex is placed"
" at the depth of the 3D cursor."

msgid ""
"To create interconnected vertices, you can add a vertex and continuously "
"make subsequent :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` operations with the last vertex selected."
" This will link the last selected vertex with the vertex created at the "
"mouse position with an edge (See Fig. :ref:`fig-mesh-basics-add-one`), "
"and will continuously create and connect new vertices if you continue "
"repeating this operation."

msgid ""
"If you have two vertices selected and already connected with an edge, "
":kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` click will create a planar face, also known as a quad. "
"Blender will follow your mouse cursor and will use the planar view from "
"your viewport to create those quads."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/editing/basics/adding.rst:58
msgid ""
"For :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB`, Blender will automatically rotate the last selected "
"Edge (the source) for the subsequent operations if you have at least one "
"face created, dividing the angles created between the newly created edge "
"and the last two edges, creating a smooth angle between them. Blender "
"will calculate this angle using the last positive and negative position "
"of the last X and Y coordinates and the last connected unselected edge. "
"If this angle exceeds a negative limit (following a quadrant rule) "
"between the recently created edge and the last two, Blender will wrap the"
" faces. But if you do not want Blender to rotate and smooth edges "
"automatically when extruding from :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB`, you can also inhibit "
"Blender from rotating sources using the shortcut :kbd:`Shift-Ctrl-LMB`. "
"In this case, Blender will not rotate the source dividing the angle "
"between those edges when creating a face."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/editing/basics/adding.rst:68
msgid ""
"For both cases, Blender will inform the user about the source rotation "
"during the creation process. If you look at the Operator Panel and press "
":kbd:`Ctrl-LMB`, you will see that the Rotate Source is automatically "
"checked and if :kbd:`Shift-Ctrl-LMB` is used, it will be automatically "
"unchecked."

"If you have three or more vertices selected, and :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` click, "
"you will also create planar faces, but along the vertices selected, "
"following the direction of the cursor. This operation is similar to an "
"extrude operation, which is explained in the :doc:`Extrude "
"</modeling/meshes/editing/duplicating/extrude>` page."

msgid ""
"When adding Objects with :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB`, the extrusions of the selected "
"elements, being vertices, edges and faces with the :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB`, are "
"viewport dependent. This means, once you change your viewport, for "
"example, from top to left, bottom or right, the extrusion direction will "
"also follow your viewport and align your extrusions with your planar "
"view."
