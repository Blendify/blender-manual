"The *X Mirror* option of the *Mesh Options* panel allows you to edit "
"symmetrical vertices on the other side of the mesh in a single action. "
"When you transform an element (vertex, edge or face), if there is its "
"exact X-mirrored counterpart (in local space), it will be transformed "
"accordingly, through a symmetry along the local X axis."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/editing/mesh_options.rst:25
msgid ""
"The conditions for *X Mirror* to work are quite strict, which can make it"
" difficult to use. To have an exact mirrored version of a (half) mesh, "
"it's easier and simpler to use the :doc:`Mirror Modifier "
"</modeling/modifiers/generate/mirror>`."

msgid ""
"When using the *X Mirror* option to work on mirrored Mesh Geometry, the "
"vertices that are mirrored must be perfectly placed. If they are not "
"exactly positioned in their mirror locations then *X Mirror* will not "
"treat those vertices as mirrored."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/editing/mesh_options.rst:44
msgid ""
"*Topology Mirror* tries to address this problem by determining which "
"vertices are mirrored vertices not only by using their positions but also"
" by looking at how those vertices are related to others in the Mesh "
"Geometry. It looks at the overall topology to determine if particular "
"vertices will be treated as mirrored. The effect of this is that mirrored"
" vertices can be non-symmetrical and yet still be treated as mirrored "
"when *X Mirror* and *Topology Mirror* are both active."

"The *Topology Mirror* functionality will work more reliably on mesh "
"geometry which is more detailed. If you use very simple geometry, for "
"example a *Cube* or *UV Sphere*, the *Topology Mirror* option will often "
"not work."
