"Creation of a mesh primitive typically starts by adding a mesh object in "
"*Object Mode*. Limited types of editing such as size, location, and "

"More detailed editing of the mesh model shape is done in *Edit Mode*, and"
" *Sculpt Mode*. The nature of these three modes determines the tools that"
" are available within the various panels of the 3D View. Switching "
"between modes while modeling is common. Some tools may be available in "
"more than one mode while others may be unique to a particular mode."
