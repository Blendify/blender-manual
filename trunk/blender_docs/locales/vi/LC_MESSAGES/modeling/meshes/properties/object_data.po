"In geometry, a normal is a direction or line that is perpendicular to "
"something, typically a triangle or surface but can also be relative to a "
"line, a tangent line for a point on a curve, or a tangent plane for a "
"point on a surface. Normals help to determine the shading of the mesh "
"among other things."
