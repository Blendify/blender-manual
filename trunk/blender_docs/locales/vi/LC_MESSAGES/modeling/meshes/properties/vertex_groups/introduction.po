"Vertex Groups are mainly used to tag the vertices belonging to parts of a"
" Mesh Object or :term:`Lattice`. Think of the legs of a chair or the "
"hinges of a door, or hands, arms, limbs, head, feet, etc. of a character."
" In addition you can assign different *weight values* (in the range [ "
"0.0, 1.0 ] ) to the vertices within a Vertex Group. Hence Vertex Groups "
"are sometimes also named *Weight Groups*."

"Many more usage scenarios are possible. Actually you can use *Vertex "
"Groups* for whatever makes sense to you. In some contexts Vertex Groups "
"can also be automatically generated (e.g. for rigged objects). However, "
"in this section we will focus on manually created (user-defined) Vertex "
"Groups."
