"Surface selection in *Edit Mode* is very similar to :doc:`NURBS curve "
"selection </modeling/curves/editing/introduction>`. The basic tools are "
"the same as with :doc:`meshes </modeling/meshes/selecting/introduction>`,"
" so you can select a simple control point with an :kbd:`LMB`\\ -click, "
"add to current selection with :kbd:`Shift-LMB` clicks, :kbd:`B` order-"
"select, and so on."

"This option works a bit like :ref:`edge loop selection <modeling-meshes-"
"selecting-edge-loops>` for meshes, inasmuch it selects a whole :ref:`row "
"<modeling-surfaces-rows-grids>` of control points, based on the active "
"(the last selected) one. The first time you press :kbd:`Shift-R`, the V "
"row passing through (containing) the active point will be added to the "
"*current* selection. If you use again this shortcut, you will toggle "
