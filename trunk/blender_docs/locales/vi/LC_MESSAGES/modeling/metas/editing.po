msgid ""
"Together with *Threshold*, *Stiffness* controls the influencing range. "

msgid ""
"Scaling the inner green circle changes the *Stiffness* value. Stiffness "
"defines how much the meta object is filled. This essentially defines how "
"sensitive a meta is to being affected by other metas. With a low "
"stiffness, the meta will begin to deform from further away. A higher "
"value means the meta needs to be close to another one to begin merging."

#: ../../manual/modeling/metas/editing.rst:43
msgid ""
"When a *Meta* object comes within \"range\" of another meta, the two will"
" begin to interact with each other. They do not necessarily need to "
"intersect, and depending on the *Threshold* and *Stiffness* settings, "
"they most likely will not need to. *Stiffness* is materialized by the "
"*green ring*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/metas/editing.rst:48
msgid ""
"The range is from (0.0 to 10.0). But to be visible, the *Stiffness* must "

"*Meta* objects have different behavior in *Object Mode* than other object"

msgstr ""

"A \"family\" is a way to regroup several meta objects, producing "
"something very similar to having several metas inside the same object."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/metas/editing.rst:130
msgid ""
"A family is defined by the left part of an object's name (the one before "
"the dot). Remember, an object's name is the one in the *Object name* "
"field, in most panels, **not** the *Metaball name* field, which is the "
"meta data-block's name... For example, the *family* part of "
"\"MetaPlane.001\" is ``MetaPlane``. Each meta object in the same "
"\"family\" is associated with one another as discussed below."
msgstr ""

msgid "Meta ball family."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/metas/editing.rst:141
msgid ""
"Families of metas are controlled by a *base* meta object which is "
"identified by an object name **without** a right number part. For "
"example, if we have five metas called \"MetaThing\", \"MetaThing.001\", "
"\"MetaThing.002\", \"MetaThing.003\" and \"MetaThing.004\", the *base* "
"meta object would be \"MetaThing\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/metas/editing.rst:147
msgid ""
"The *base* meta object determines the basis, the resolution, the "
"threshold, *and* the transformations. It also has the material and "
"texture area. The *base* meta is effectively the parent of (or perhaps a "
"better word to use is \"the owner of\") the other metas in the group "
"(i.e. it is as if the other metas were \"included\" or joined into the "
"base one)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/metas/editing.rst:155
msgid ""
"When working with multiple scenes, take care naming your meta objects so "
"the *base* is always in the same scene as other metas."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/metas/editing.rst:158
msgid "Failing to do this will give confusing behavior (invisible meta objects)."

msgid "Meta ball base."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/metas/editing.rst:171
msgid ""
"Fig. :ref:`fig-meta-ball-base` shows the *base* meta labeled \"B\". The "
"other two *Meta* objects are *children*. Children's selection rings are "
"always black, while the group's mesh is orange. Because the metas are "
"grouped, they form a unified mesh which can always be selected by "
"selecting the mesh of any meta in the group. For example, in Fig. :ref"
":`fig-meta-ball-base`, only the lower sphere (the parent) has been "
"selected, and you see that both the parent's mesh *and* all of the "
"children's meshes are now highlighted."
msgstr ""

msgid "Scaling the \"base\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/metas/editing.rst:185
msgid ""
"The *base* meta object controls the *polygonalization* (mesh structure) "
"for the group, and as such, also controls the polygonalization for the "
"children (non-base) metas. If we transform the *base* meta, the "
"children's polygonalization changes. However, if we transform the "
"children, the polygonalization remains unchanged."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/metas/editing.rst:192
msgid ""
"This discussion of \"polygonization\" does *not* mean that the various "
"meshes do not deform towards or away from each other (meta objects always"
" influence one another in the usual way, whether or not they are members "
"of the same family). Rather, it means that the underlying mesh structure "
"changes only when the *base* object transforms. For example, if you scale"
" the *base*, the children's mesh structure changes. In Fig. :ref:`fig-"
"meta-ball-scale`, the *base* has been scaled down, which has the effect "
"of scaling the mesh structure of each of the children. As you can see, "
"the children's mesh resolution has increased, while the *base* decreased."
" The children did *not* change size!"
