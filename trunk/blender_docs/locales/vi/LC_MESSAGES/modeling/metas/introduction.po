"Meta objects are *implicit surfaces*, meaning that they are *not "
"explicitly* defined by vertices (as meshes are) or control points (as "
"surfaces are): they exist *procedurally*. Meta objects are literally "
"mathematical formulas that are calculated on-the-fly by Blender."

"A very distinct visual characteristic of metas is that they are fluid "
"*mercurial*, or *clay-like* forms that have a \"rounded\" shape. "
"Furthermore, when two meta objects get close to one another, they begin "
"to interact with one another. They \"blend\" or \"merge\", as water "
"droplets do, especially in zero-g (which, by the way, makes them very "
"handy for modeling streams of water when you do not want to do a fluid "
"simulation). If they subsequently move away from one another, they "
"restore their original shape."

"Each of these is defined by its own underlying mathematical structure "
"(:doc:`/modeling/metas/structure`), and you can at any time switch "
"between them using the *Active Element* panel."

"Typically *Meta* objects are used for special effects or as a basis for "
"modeling. For example, you could use a collection of metas to form the "
"initial shape of your model and then convert it to a mesh for further "
"modeling. Meta objects are also very efficient for ray tracing."

"In *Edit Mode* (Fig. :ref:`fig-meta-ball-example`), a meta is drawn as a "
"mesh (either shaded or as black wireframe, but without any vertex of "
"course), with two colored circles a red one for selection (pink when "
"selected), and a green one for a direct control of the meta's stiffness "
"(light green when active). Note that except for the *Scale* :kbd:`S` "
"transformation, having the green circle highlighted is equivalent to "
"having the red one."
