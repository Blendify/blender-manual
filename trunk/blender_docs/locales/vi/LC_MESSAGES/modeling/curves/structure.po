"The main elements used in editing Bézier curves are the control points "
"and handles. A segment (the actual curve) is found between two control "
"points. The handles define the curvature of the segment."

"In the image below, the control points can be found in the middle of the "
"pink line, while the handles comprise the extensions from the control "
"point. The arrows visualize the normals of the curve, which indicate i.a."
" the direction and the tilt."

"This handle has a completely automatic length and direction which is set "

"Both parts of a handle always point to the previous handle or the next "
"handle which allows you to create curves or sections thereof made of "

"N.U.R.B.S. is the abbreviation of Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines. One of "
"the major differences between Bézier objects and NURBS objects is that "
"Bézier curves are approximations. For example, a Bézier circle is an "
"*approximation* of a circle, whereas a NURBS circle is an *exact* circle."
" NURBS theory can be a *very* complicated topic. For an introduction, "
"please consult the `Wikipedia page "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NURBS>`__."
