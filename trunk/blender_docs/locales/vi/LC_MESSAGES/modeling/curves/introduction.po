"Curves and :doc:`Surfaces </modeling/surfaces/introduction>` are "
"particular types of Blender Objects. They are expressed by mathematical "
"functions rather than a series of points."

"Blender offers both :ref:`curve-bezier` and :ref:`curve-nurbs`. Both "
"Bézier curves and NURBS curves and surfaces are defined in terms of a set"
" of \"control points\" (or \"control vertices\") which define a \"control"
" polygon\"."

"Both Bézier and NURBS curves are named after their mathematical "
"definitions, and choosing between them is often more a matter of how they"
" are computed behind the scenes than how they appear from a modeler's "
"perspective. Bézier curves are generally more intuitive because they "
"start and end at the control points that you set, but NURBS curves are "
"more efficient for the computer to calculate when there are many twists "
"and turns in a curve."

"The main advantage to using curves instead of polygonal meshes is that "
"curves are defined by less data and so can produce results using less "
"memory and storage space at modeling time. However, this procedural "
"approach to surfaces can increase demands at render time."

msgid ""
"Certain modeling techniques, such as :doc:`extruding a profile along a "
"path </modeling/curves/properties/geometry>`, are possible only using "
"curves. On the other hand, when using curves, vertex-level control is "
"more difficult and if fine control is necessary, :doc:`mesh editing "
"</modeling/meshes/editing/introduction>` may be a better modeling option."
