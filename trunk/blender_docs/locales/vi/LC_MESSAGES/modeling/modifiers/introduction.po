"Modifiers are automatic operations that affect an object in a non-"
"destructive way. With modifiers, you can perform many effects "
"automatically that would otherwise be too tedious to do manually (such as"
" subdivision surfaces) and without affecting the base geometry of your "
"object."

"They work by changing how an object is displayed and rendered, but not "
"the geometry which you can edit directly. You can add several modifiers "
"to a single object to form `The Modifier Stack`_ and *Apply* a modifier "
"if you wish to make its changes permanent."
