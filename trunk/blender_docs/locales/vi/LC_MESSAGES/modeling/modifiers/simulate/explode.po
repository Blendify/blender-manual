msgid ""
"The Explode Modifier is used to alter the mesh geometry by "
"moving/rotating its faces in a way that roughly tracks particles emitted "
"by that object, making it look as if the mesh is being exploded (broken "
"apart and pushed outward)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/simulate/explode.rst:11
msgid ""
"For the Explode Modifier to have a visible effect, there needs to be "
"particle system on it. The particle system on the mesh is what controls "
"how the mesh will be exploded, and therefore without the particle system "
"the mesh will not appear to alter."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/simulate/explode.rst:15
msgid ""
"Both the number of emitted particles and number of faces determine how "
"granular the Explode Modifier will be. More faces and more particles will"
" mean more individual pieces."
