"shall always be used for this purpose, once set of source data to "
"transfer is selected. It should also be well understood that creating "
"those data layers on destination mesh is **not** part of the modifier "
"stack, which means e.g. that they will remain even once the modifier is "
"deleted, or if source data selection is modified."
