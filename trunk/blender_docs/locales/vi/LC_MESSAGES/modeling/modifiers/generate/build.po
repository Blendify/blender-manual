"By default, faces appear in the order in which they are stored in memory "

"The Build Modifier is often useful when needing a way to get a large "
"number of items to progressively appear, without resorting to animating "
"the visibility of each one by one. Examples of this include a mesh "
"containing vertices only, which is used as a duplivert emitter, and has "
"the build modifier on it. Such a setup is a workaround/technique for "
"being able to art-direct some semi-random layout of a collection of "
"objects (i.e. leaves/balls forming a carpet of sorts) when doing so with "
"particles is not desirable (e.g. due to undesirable distribution of items"
" leaving random gaps and overlapping in other places)."
