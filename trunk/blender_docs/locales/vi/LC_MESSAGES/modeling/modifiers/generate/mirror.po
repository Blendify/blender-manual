"The first image above shows the Subdivision Surface Modifier placed "

"far away from the *Merge Limit*."

"To apply a Mirror Modifier, it is common to have to move the object's "

"can be tricky when attempted visually."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/generate/mirror.rst:142
msgid ""
"A good technique to achieve an exact position is to select the edge, then"
" use :kbd:`Shift-S` and choosing *Cursor to Selection*. This will "
"position the 3D Cursor in the center of the edge. Finally, press :kbd"
":`Shift-Ctrl-Alt-C` for the *Set Origin* menu, then select *Origin to 3D "
"Cursor*. This will move the object's center (and thus, the mirror plane) "
"to where the 3D cursor is located, and the mirroring will be exact."
