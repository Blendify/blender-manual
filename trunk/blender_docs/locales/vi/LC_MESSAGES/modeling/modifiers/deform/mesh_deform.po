"The Mesh Deform Modifier allows an arbitrary mesh (of any closed shape) "
"to act as a deformation cage around another mesh."

msgid ""
"The Mesh Deform Modifier is reasonably easy to use but it can be very "
"slow to do the calculations needed to properly map the deform mesh cage "
"to the deformed object."

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/deform/mesh_deform.rst:25
msgid ""
"An optional vertex group of the object's mesh to restrict the vertices "
"that will be affected by this modifier. Vertices not in this group will "
"not be deformed."

"Inverts the influence of the selected vertex group, meaning that the "

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/deform/mesh_deform.rst:36
msgid ""
"The *Precision* number button controls the accuracy with which the deform"
" mesh cage alters the deformed object, when the points on the cage are "
"moved. Raising this value higher can greatly increase the time it takes "
"the Mesh Deform Modifier to complete its binding calculations, but it "
"will get more accurate cage mapping to the deformed object."

"When activated, other mesh altering features (such as other modifiers and"

"The setting is deactivated by default to save memory and processing time "

msgid ""
"Links the current vertex positions of both the modified geometry and the "

" cage actually alters the shape of the modified object."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/deform/mesh_deform.rst:60
msgid ""
"Depending on the settings of the Mesh Deform Modifier and complexity of "
"the deform mesh cage and/or deformed object, it can take a long time for "
"this operation to complete. This can result in Blender not responding to "
"user's actions until it has completed."

msgid ""
"When a deformed object has been associated to a deform mesh cage, it can "
"later be disassociated by clicking the *Unbind* button which replaced the"
" *Bind* one. When *Unbind* is clicked, the *deform mesh cage* will keep "

"shape."

"The deformed object will, however, reset back to its original shape that "
"it had before it was bound to the deform mesh cage."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/deform/mesh_deform.rst:81
msgid ""
"Significant changes to the entire change mesh *(such as rotating the cage"
" upside down)* can cause noticeable artifacts."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/deform/mesh_deform.rst:84
msgid ""
"These can be reduced by binding with a higher *Precision*, however, it is"

msgid ""
"Besides the outer cage, more faces within the cage, either loose or "
"forming another smaller cage, can be used for extra control. Such smaller"
" cages may also overlap with the main cage; for example, to get extra "
"control over eyes, two small sphere cages could be added around them."
