"Compositing Nodes allow you to assemble and enhance an image (or movie). "
"Using composition nodes, you can glue two pieces of footage together and "
"colorize the whole sequence all at once. You can enhance the colors of a "
"single image or an entire movie clip in a static manner or in a dynamic "
"way that changes over time (as the clip progresses). In this way, you use"
" composition nodes to both assemble video clips together and enhance "
"them."

"The term *Image* may refer to a single picture, a picture in a numbered "

"To save a sequence of images, for example, if you input a movie clip or "
