"For this example the model was shot against a *white* background. Using "
"the Luminance Key node, we get a matte out where the background is white,"
" and the model is black; the opposite of what we want. If we wanted to "
"use the matte, we have to switch the white and the black. How to do this?"
" Color Ramp node to the rescue -- we set the left color to White Alpha "
"1.0, and the right color to be Black Alpha 0.0. Thus, when the Color Ramp"
" gets in black, it spits out white, and vice versa. The reversed mask is "
"shown; her white outline is usable as an alpha mask now."

"Now to mix, we do not really need the *Alpha Over* node; we can just use "
"the mask as our Factor input. In this kinda weird case, we can use the "
"matte directly; we just switch the input nodes. As you can see, since the"
" matte is white (1.0) where we do not want to use the model picture, we "
"feed the background photo to the bottom socket (recall the mix node uses "
"the top socket where the factor is 0.0, and the bottom socket where the "
"factor is 1.0). Feeding our original photo into the top socket means it "
"will be used where the Luminance Key node has spit out Black. Voil√†, our "
"model is teleported from Atlanta to aboard a cruise ship docked in Miami."
