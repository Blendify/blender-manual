"In the real world, all camera lenses produce some or the other sort of "
"lens distortion. But, whatever we render has got no distortion. So, this "
"node helps in removing distortion from movies or adding distortion to "
"render to make our render blend in with the movie clip."

"Before using this node, one has to calculate the lens distortion of the "

"For the first case, it is recommended to distort the render and leave the"

"extra pixel information, which is not available to Blender. Similarly, in"

"extra unavailable pixels. Doing the wrong method in the wrong case can "
