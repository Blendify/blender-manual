"In the example above, render output from two scenes are mixed using the "
"Z-Offset node, one from a sphere of size 1.30, and the other a cube of "
"size 1.00. The sphere and square are located at the same place. The cube "
"is tipped forward, so the corner in the center is closer to the camera "
"than the sphere surface; so Z-Offset chooses to use the cube's pixels. "
"But the sphere is slightly larger (a size of 1.30 versus 1.00), so it "
"does not fit totally inside the cube. At some point, as the cube's sides "
"recede back away from the camera, the sphere's sides are closer. When "
"this happens, Z-offset uses the sphere's pixels to form the resulting "
"picture."

"This node can be used to combine a foreground with a background matte "

"created the illusion of depth as Bambi moved through the forest."

"In this node setup a render scene is mixed with a flat image. In the side"

" the gray ball is 20. The 3D cursor is about 15 units away from the "

"between the cube and the ball. The resulting image appears to have the "
"cube on the table."
