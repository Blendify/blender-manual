"This is not, and is not intended to be, a general-purpose solution to the"

" You might wish to use \"Chroma Keying\" or \"Difference Keying\" (as "
"discussed elsewhere) if you can. This node is most often used (with a "
"suitable input being provided by means of the socket) in those "
"troublesome cases when you *cannot*, for some reason, use those "
"techniques directly."

"To transition the audience from one scene or shot to another, a common "
"technique is to \"fade to black\". As its name implies, the scene fades "
"to a black screen. You can also \"fade to white\" or whatever color you "
"wish, but black is a good neutral color that is easy on the eyes and "
"intellectually \"resets\" the viewer's mind. The node map below shows how"
" to do this using the Set Alpha node."

"In the example above, the alpha channel of the swirl image is ignored. "
"Instead, a :doc:`time node </compositing/types/input/time>` introduces a "
"factor from 0.00 to 1.00 over 60 frames, or about 2 seconds, to the Set "
"Alpha node. Note that the time curve is exponentially-shaped, so that the"
" overall blackness will fade in slowly and then accelerate toward the "
"end. The Set Alpha node does not need an input image; instead, the flat "
"(shadeless) black color is used. The Set Alpha Node uses the input factor"
" and color to create a black image that has an alpha set which goes from "
"0.00 to 1.00 over 60 frames, or completely transparent to completely "
"opaque. Think of alpha as a multiplier for how vivid you can see that "
"pixel. These two images are combined by the Alpha Over node completely (a"
" *Factor* of 1.00) to produce the composite image. The Set Alpha node "
"will thus, depending on the frame being rendered, produce a black image "
"that has some degree of transparency. Setup and Animate, and you have an "
"image sequence that fades to black over a 2-second period."

"This example node map does not use the Render Layer node. To produce this"
" 2-second animation, no Blender scene information was used. This is an "
"example of using Blender's powerful compositing abilities separate from "
"its modeling and animation capabilities. (A Render Layer could be "
"substituted for the Image layer, and the \"fade-network\" effect will "
"still produce the same effect)."
