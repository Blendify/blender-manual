"The Vector Blur node is a fast method for simulating :term:`Motion blur` "
"in compositing. It uses the vector speed render pass to blur the image "
"pixels in 2D."

msgid ""
"Even with a correct compositing setup with Image, Z and Speed nodes all "
"linked to the appropriate passes, there may still be artifacts. The 2D "
"render passes does not contain 3D information, and so the information "
"what is behind a moving object or outside the camera view is lost."

msgid ""
"Better results can be achieved by rendering the scene into multiple "
"render layers, applying vector blur to each render layer, and then "
"compositing the results together. Typically an animated character would "
"be rendered in a separate render layer than the background set. "
"Especially if hair or transparency is involved this is important."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/compositing/types/filter/vector_blur.rst:69
msgid ""
"For other artifacts it can help to slightly blur the Speed pass or to set"
" a Maximum Speed limit. This helps to smoothen out the motion, but too "
"much blurring leads to its own problems."
