"As far as Physics is concerned, this type is equivalent to Rigid Object "
"\"No collision\". The reason why the Occluder mode is mutually exclusive "
"with other physics mode is to emphasize the fact that occluders should be"
" specifically designed for that purpose and not every mesh should be an "
"occluder. However, you can enable the Occlusion capability on physics "
"objects using Python and Logic bricks. See (Link- TODO)."

"When an occluder object enters the view frustum, the BGE builds a Z-depth"
" buffer from the faces of that object. Whether the faces are one-side or "
"two-side is important: only the front faces and two-side faces are used "
"to build the Z-depth buffer. If multiple occluders are in the view "
"frustum, the BGE combines them and keeps the most foreground faces."

"By default the resolution is 128 pixels for the largest dimension of the "

"To further optimize the feature, the BGE builds and uses the Z-depth "

"Occlusion culling is most useful when the occluders are large objects "
"(buildings, mountains...) that hide many complex objects in an "

"even if you use it inappropriately, the performance decrease will be "
"limited due to the structure of the algorithm."

"Example: a house full of complex objects. Although occlusion culling will"

"For example, a terrain is not a good candidate for occlusion: too many "
"faces and too many overlap. Occluder can be invisible objects placed "
"inside more complex objects (e.g. \"in the walls\" of a building with "

"will see objects."
