"The most advanced type of object in the Game Engine. Also, it is the most"
" finicky. If you are used to the fun experimentation that comes from "
"playing around with the non-BGE soft body simulations (such as Cloth), "
"you will probably find a frustrating lack of options and exciting "
"results. Do not despair, we are here to help you get some reasonable "
"settings."
