msgid ""
"Static objects participates in the simulation, affecting other objects, "
"but are not affected by it. Meaning they do not react to physics, "
"including gravity and collisions and this way will remain unresponsive in"
" terms of location, rotation, or deformation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/game_engine/physics/types/static.rst:10
msgid ""
"It will, however, give collision reactions. Objects will bounce off of "
"Static Objects, and rotational inertia will transfer to objects capable "
"of rotating (that is, rigid body objects will spin in response, though "
"Dynamic Objects will not)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that none of this prevents you from transforming the Static Objects "
"with :doc:`Logic Bricks </game_engine/logic/index>` or Python code. The "
"visual objects will correctly move and their physics representation will "
"update in the engine as well."

"Another important note is that the default `Collision Bounds`_ is a "
"Triangle Mesh, meaning it is higher in computational requirements but "
"also in detail. This in turn means the \"Radius\" option has no effect by"
" default."

"Note that, most of these properties are accessible through the non-BGE "
"scripting API via ``bpy.data.objects[\"ObjectName\"].game``, which is of "
"type ``bpy.types.GameObjectSetting``. This is useful, for example, to set"
