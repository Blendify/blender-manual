"The Vehicle Controller is a special type of physics object that the "
"Physics Engine (bullet) recognizes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/game_engine/physics/types/vehicle.rst:11
msgid ""
"It is composed of a *rigid body* representing the chassis and a set of "
"wheels that are set to *no collision*. Emphasizing the distinction "
"between a Game Engine, Logical or Render object and its representation "
"for the Physics Engine is important."

msgid ""
"To simulate a vehicle as a true rigid body, on top of also rigid body "
"wheels, with a real suspension system made with joints, would be far too "
"complicated and unstable. Cars and other vehicles are complicated "
"mechanical devices and most often we do not want to simulate that, only "
"that it 'acts as expected'. The Vehicle Controller exists to provide a "
"dedicated way of simulating a vehicle behavior without having to simulate"
" all the physics that would actually happen in the real world. It "
"abstracts the complexity away by providing a simple interface with "
"tweakable parameters such as suspension force, damping and compression."

#: ../../manual/game_engine/physics/types/vehicle.rst:28
msgid ""
"Bullet's approach to a vehicle controller is called a \"Raycast "
"Vehicle\". Collision detection for the wheels is approximated by ray "
"casts and the tire friction is an anisotropic friction model."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/game_engine/physics/types/vehicle.rst:32
msgid ""
"A raycast vehicle works by casting a ray for each wheel. Using the ray's "
"intersection point, we can calculate the suspension length and hence the "
"suspension force that is then applied to the chassis, keeping it from "
"hitting the ground. In effect, the vehicle chassis 'floats' along on the "
"rays."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/game_engine/physics/types/vehicle.rst:37
msgid ""
"The friction force is calculated for each wheel where the ray contacts "
"the ground. This is applied as a sideways and forwards force."

"You can check Kester Maddock's approach to vehicle simulation `here "

"Currently the Vehicle Controller can only be used as a constraint via "
"Python. There are plans to add it to the interface."

#: ../../manual/game_engine/physics/types/vehicle.rst:57
msgid ""
"The wheels should be separate objects set to 'No Collision'. The vehicle "
"controller will calculate the collisions for you as rays so, if you set "
"it to something else, it will calculate it twice in different ways and "
"produce weird results."

msgid "Collisions"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/game_engine/physics/types/vehicle.rst:65
msgid ""
"A cylinder is typically a good collision shape for the wheels. For the "
"chassis, the shape should be rough, like a box. If the vehicle is very "
"complicated, you should split it into simpler objects and parent those "
"(with their collision shapes) to the vehicle controller so that they will"
" follow it. If your vehicle even has moving bits (weapons, wrecking "
"balls, trolleys, etc.) they should also be simulated separately and "
"connected to the vehicle as a joint."

"This is done in two parts and it should be modeled according to the "
"desired behavior. You should think of your gameplay and research "
"appropriate functions for the input. For instance, can the vehicle "
"reverse? jump? drift? does it turn slowly? How much time does it take to "
"brake or get to full speed? The first part is *response to keys*. "
"Whenever the player presses a key, you should set a value accordingly, "
