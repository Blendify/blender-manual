" or a bunch of objects collapsing, falling, or bouncing with accurate "

"adjusting with F-Curves to simulate physics and acceleration, or, you can"
" do it much easier and automatically by taking advantage of Blender Game "
"Engine Physics. Blender now has a feature which allows you to record "
"animation in a Blender game and turn it into Blender Animation Keyframes."
