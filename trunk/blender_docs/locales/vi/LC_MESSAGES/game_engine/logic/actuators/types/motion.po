"*Simple Motion* gives control over position and velocity, but does this "
"as an instant displacement; the object never passes any of the "
"coordinates between the start and end positions. This can interfere with "
"the physical simulation of other objects, and can cause an object to go "
"through another object. The `Servo Control`_ actuator does not suffer "
"from this, since it produces physically correct velocities, and leaves "
"updating the position to the physics simulation."

"The Servo Control actuator influences the velocity of a game object by "
"applying forces, resulting in correct behavior when colliding with other "
"objects controlled by the physics simulation. The amount of force "
"necessary is determined by a `PID controller "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller>`__, a type of controller "
"that is often used in control systems. Only the positional velocity is "
"influenced by this actuator; it does not control rotation at all, and it "
"controls position only indirectly."

"Controlling the position is not necessary in that respect; that is left "
"to a player moving the object via direction-type controls (such as the "

"setting a different target velocity."

"This controls the reaction to the sum of errors so far. Using only the "

" friction: some velocity delta is necessary to produce the force that "
"compensates the friction. Using the Integral component suppresses this "
"effect (the target velocity is achieved on average) but can create "
"oscillations; the control will speed to compensate the initial velocity "
"error. To avoid the oscillation, the Proportional component must be used "
"with the Integral component (the Proportional component damps the "

"systematically when you change the Integral Coefficient."
