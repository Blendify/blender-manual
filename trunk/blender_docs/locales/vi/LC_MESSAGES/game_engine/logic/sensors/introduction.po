"Sensors are the logic bricks that cause the logic to do anything. Sensors"
" give an output when something happens, e.g. a trigger event such as a "
"collision between two objects, a key pressed on the keyboard, or a timer "
"for a timed event going off. When a sensor is triggered, a positive pulse"
" is sent to all controllers that are linked to it."
