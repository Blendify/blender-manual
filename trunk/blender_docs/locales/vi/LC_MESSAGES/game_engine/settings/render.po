"There are two separate game \"players\" for previewing the game during "
"development. The Embedded Player renders onto the 3D scene pane in the "
"Blender GUI using the current perspective and zoom level of the 3D "
"preview. The Standalone Player renders the scene from the perspective of "
"the active scene camera and either creates a new desktop window or "
"switches into fullscreen rendering mode. Note that while the Game Engine "
"is running in either player, the computer's mouse and keyboard are "
"captured by the game and by default, the mouse cursor is not visible. To "
"exit the game, press the :kbd:`Esc` key."

"(*Fullscreen* checkbox checked), the *Resolution* controls set the "
