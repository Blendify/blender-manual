msgid ""
"When creating visual assets it is often desirable to have a high amount "
"of detail in the asset for up close viewing. However, this high amount of"
" detail is wasted if the object is viewed from a distance, and brings "
"down the scene's performance. To solve this, the asset can be swapped out"
" at certain viewing distances. This is commonly referred to as a level of"
" detail system. Each visual step of the asset is known as a level of "
"detail. Levels of detail are most appropriate to use when you have a "
"large scene where certain objects can be viewed both up close and from a "
"distance."

"Level of detail settings can be found in the Object settings when the "
"renderer is set to Blender Game. In the Levels of Detail panel is a "
"button to add a new level of detail to the current object. The settings "
"for each level of detail are displayed in its own box. The exception to "
"this is the base level of detail. This is automatically setup as the "
"current object with a distance setting of 0. To remove a level of detail,"
" click on the X button in the top right corner of the box of the level to"
" be removed."

" make use of this tool, your naming must be consistent, and each level "
"must be prefixed or suffixed with \"lodx\" where x is the level that "
"object is intended for. The case on \"lod\" must be consistent across all"
