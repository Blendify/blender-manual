"This feature allows artists to visualize their interactive projects "
"within an immersive dome environment. In order to make it an extensible "
"tool, we are supporting Fulldome, Truncated domes (front and rear), "

"The Dome camera uses a multi-pass texture algorithm as developed by Paul "
"Bourke and was implemented by Dalai Felinto with sponsorship from SAT -- "
"Society for Arts and Technology within the SAT Metalab `immersion "
"research program "
"<http://paulbourke.net/miscellaneous/domemirror/BlenderiDome/>`__, that "
"involves rendering the scene four times and placing the subsequent images"
" onto a mesh designed especially such that the result, when viewed with "
"an orthographic camera, is a fisheye projection."

"maximize it (:kbd:`Ctrl-Up`) you cannot get the whole screen free to run "
