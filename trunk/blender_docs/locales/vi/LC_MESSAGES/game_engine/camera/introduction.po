"The Game Engine camera is in many ways similar to the Camera in the "
"normal Blender Render system, and is created, parameterized and "
"manipulated in similar ways. However, because of its use as a real-time "
"device, the Game Engine camera has a number of additional features -- it "
"may be used as not only as a static camera, but also as a moving device "
"with its default characteristics (i.e. with its own programmed moves), or"
" it may track another object in the game. Furthermore, any game object "
"may be used as a camera; the view is taken from the object's origin "
"point. Lastly, it may be given special capabilities such as Stereo "
"vision, Dome visualization, etc. which have special relevance to game "
"technology."

"When you start the Game Engine, the initial camera view is taken from the"
" latest 3D View. This may be either a selected camera object or the "
"default camera (see below). Thus to start the game with a particular "
"camera, you must select the camera and press :kbd:`Numpad0` before "
"starting the Game Engine."

"The default camera view is taken from the latest 3D View, at a distance "
"equivalent to the viewer. This means that if the normal 3D View is "
"active, the scene does not change when the Game Engine is started."

"The Camera object in the Game Engine follows much the same structure as "
"the conventional Blender camera -- see :doc:`Camera "
"</render/blender_render/camera/index>` for details of how to set up, "
"manipulate and select a camera. The following sections show some of the "
"special facilities available in BGE cameras."

"The easiest way to accomplish this is to select your object and "
":kbd:`Tab` to *Edit Mode*. Now select the vertex and :kbd:`Tab` back to "
"*Object Mode*."
