"Blender and the Blender Game Engine (BGE) are licensed as GNU GPL, which "
"means that your games (if they include Blender software) have to comply "
"with that license as well. This only applies to the software, or the "
"bundle if it has software in it, not to the artwork you make with "
"Blender. All your Blender creations are your sole property."

"GNU GPL -- also called \"Free Software\" -- is a license that aims at "
"keeping the licensed software free, forever. GNU GPL does not allow you "
"to add new restrictions or limitations on the software you received under"
" that license. That works fine if you want your clients or your audience "
"to have the same rights as you have (with Blender)."

"In summary, the software and source code are bound to the GNU GPL, but "

"In case you save out your game as a single \"Standalone\" the blend-file "
"gets included in the binary (the BGE player). That requires the blend-"
"file to be compatible with the GNU GPL license."

"In this case, you could decide to load and run another blend-file game "
"(using the Game Actuator logic brick). That file then is not part of the "
"binary, so you can apply any license you wish on it."
