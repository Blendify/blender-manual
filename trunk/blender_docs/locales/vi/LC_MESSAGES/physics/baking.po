":term:`Baking` refers to the act of storing or caching the results of a "
"calculation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/physics/baking.rst:10
msgid ""
"The result of a simulation is automatically cached to memory when the "
"animation is played, so that the next time it runs, it can be replayed "
"more quickly by reading the results from the memory."

msgid ""
"If you bake the simulation the cache is protected, and you will be unable"
" to change the simulation settings until you clear the baked frames by "
"clicking *Free Bake*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/physics/baking.rst:17
msgid ""
"It is generally recommended to bake your physics simulations before "
"rendering. Aside from no longer needing to go through the time-consuming "
"process of simulating again, baking can help prevent potential glitches "
"and ensure that the outcome of the simulation remains exactly the same "
"every time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/physics/baking.rst:27
msgid ""
"Most physics simulators in Blender use a similar system, but not all have"
" exactly the same settings available. All the settings are covered here, "
"but individual physics types may not provide all these options."

"The cache of a baked simulation will be stored inside the blend-file when"
