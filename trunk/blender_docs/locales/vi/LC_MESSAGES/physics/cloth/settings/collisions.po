"The fastest solution is to increase the *Min Distance* setting under the "

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/physics/cloth/settings/collisions.rst:213
msgid ""
"A second method is to increase the *Quality* (in the first *Cloth* "

"a higher probability that fast-moving collisions get caught. You can also"
" increase the *Collision Quality* to perform more iterations to get "
"collisions solved."
