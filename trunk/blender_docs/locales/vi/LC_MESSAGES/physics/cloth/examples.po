"To start with cloth, the first thing you need, of course, is some fabric."
" So, let us delete the default cube and add a plane. In order to get some"
" good floppy and flexible fabric, you will need to subdivide it several "
"times, about eight is a good number. So :kbd:`Tab` into *Edit Mode*, and "
"press :kbd:`W` :menuselection:`Specials --> Subdivide multi`, and set it "
"to 8."

"Now, we will make this cloth by going to the Physics tab. Scroll down "
"until you see the *Cloth* panel, and press the *Cloth* button. Now, a lot"
" of settings will appear, most of which we will ignore for now."

"That is all you need to do to set your cloth up for animating, but if you"
" press :kbd:`Alt-A`, your lovely fabric will just drop very un-"
"spectacularly. That is what we will cover in the next two sections about "
"pinning and colliding."

"You can *Apply* the Cloth Modifier at any point to freeze the mesh in "

"start and end frames from which to run the simulation forward."

"Another example of aging is a flag. Define the flag as a simple grid "
"shape and pin the edge against the flagpole. Simulate for 50 frames or "
"so, and the flag will drop to its \"rest\" position. Apply the *Cloth* "
"Modifier. If you want the flag to flap or otherwise move in the scene, "
"re-enable it for the frame range when it is in camera view."

"Now, if you followed this from the previous section, your cloth is "
"probably looking a little blocky. In order to make it look nice and "
"smooth like the picture you need to apply a Smooth and/or Subdivision "
"Surface Modifier in the *Modifiers* tab. Then, in the Tool Shelf, find "
"the *Edit* panel and Press *Smooth*."
