"Smoke simulation is a subset of the fluids system, and can be used for "
"simulating collections of airborne solids, liquid particulates and gases,"
" such as those that make up smoke. It simulates the fluid movement of air"
" and generates animated :term:`voxel` textures representing the density, "
"heat, and velocity of other fluids or suspended particles (e.g. smoke) "
"which can be used for rendering."

"Smoke and fire are emitted into a :doc:`Domain "
"</physics/smoke/types/domain>` from a mesh object or particle system. "
"Smoke movement is controlled by airflow inside the domain, which can be "
"influenced by :doc:`smoke collision objects "
"</physics/smoke/types/collision>`. Smoke will also be affected by the "
"scene's gravity and :doc:`force fields </physics/force_fields/index>`. "
"Airflow inside the domain can affect other physics simulations via the "
"*Smoke Flow* force field."
