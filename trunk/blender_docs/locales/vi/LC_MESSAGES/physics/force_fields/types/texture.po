"You can use a *Texture* force field to create an arbitrarily complicated "
"force field, which force in the three directions is color coded. Red is "
"coding for the X axis, green for the Y axis and blue for the Z axis (like"
" the color of the coordinate axes in the 3D View). A value of 0.5 means "
"no force, a value larger than 0.5 acceleration in negative axis direction"
" (like -Z), a value smaller than 0.5 acceleration in positive axis "
"direction (like +Z)."

"Uses the color components directly as the force vector components in the "

"Calculates the force vector from the curl of the 3D-RGB texture (rotation"
