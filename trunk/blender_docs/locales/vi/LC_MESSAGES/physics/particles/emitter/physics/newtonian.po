msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/physics/particles/emitter/physics/newtonian.rst:48
msgid ""
"Also known as \"Forward Euler\". Simplest integrator. Very fast but also "
"with less exact results. If no dampening is used, particles get more and "
"more energy over time. For example, bouncing particles will bounce higher"
" and higher each time. Should not be confused with \"Backward Euler\" "
"(not implemented) which has the opposite feature, the energy decrease "
"over time, even with no dampening. Use this integrator for short "
"simulations or simulations with a lot of dampening where speedy "
"calculations are more important than accuracy."

"Also known as \"2nd order Runge-Kutta\". Slower than Euler but much more "
"stable. If the acceleration is constant (no drag for example), it is "
"energy conservative. It should be noted that in example of the bouncing "
"particles, the particles might bounce higher than they started once in a "
"while, but this is not a trend. This integrator is a generally good "
"integrator for use in most cases."
