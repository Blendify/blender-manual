"The particles will be given no motion, which makes them belong to no "
"physics system. At first a physics type that makes the particles to be "
"static could seem a bit strange, but it can be very useful at times. None"
" physics make the particles stick to their emitter their whole life time."
" The initial velocities here are for example used to give a velocity to "
"particles that are affected by a harmonic effector with this physics type"
" when the effect of the effector ends."

"ecosystems using Object, Group or Billboard types of visualization."
