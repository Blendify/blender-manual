"Set the amount of hair strands. Use as little particles as possible, "
"especially if you plan to use soft body animation later. But you need "
"enough particles to have good control. For a \"normal\" haircut I found "
"some thousand (very roughly 2000) particles to give enough control. You "
"may need a lot more particles if you plan to cover a body with fur. "
"Volume will be produced later with *Children*."
