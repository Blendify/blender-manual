"Do not be surprised, but you will get whole bunch of mesh (.bobj.gz) "
"files after a simulation. One set for preview, and another for final. "
"Each set has a ``.gz`` file for each frame of the animation. Each file "
"contains the simulation result -- so you will need them."

msgid ""
"Currently these files will not be automatically deleted, so it is a good "
"idea to e.g. create a dedicated directory to keep simulation results. "
"Doing a fluid simulation is similar to clicking the *animation* button. "
"Currently you have to take care of organizing the fluid surface meshes in"
" some directory by yourself. If you want to stop using the fluid "
"simulation, you can simply delete all the ``*fluid*.bobj.gz`` files."

"Before running a high resolution simulation that might take hours, check "
"the overall timing first by doing lower resolution runs."

"Fluid objects must be completely inside the bounding box of the domain "
"object. If not, baking may not work correctly or at all. Fluid and "
"obstacle objects can be meshes with complex geometries. Very thin objects"
" might not appear in the simulation, if the chosen resolution is too "
"coarse to resolve them (increasing it might solve this problem)."

"Do not try to do a complicated scene all at once. Blender has a powerful "
"compositor that you can use to combine multiple animations."

"For example, to produce an animation showing two separate fluid flows "
"while keeping your domain small, render one ``.avi`` using the one flow. "
"Then move the domain and render another ``.avi`` with the other flow "
"using an alpha channel (in a separate B&W .avi?). Then, composite both "
"``.avi``\\ 's using the compositor's Add node. A third ``.avi`` is "
"usually the smoke and mist and it is laid on top of everything as well. "
"Add a rain sheet on top of the mist and spray and you will have quite a "
"storm brewing! And then lightning flashes, trash blowing around, all as "
"separate animations, compositing the total for a truly spectacular "
"result."

"If the setup seems to go wrong, make sure all the normals are correct "
"(hence, enter *Edit Mode*, select all, and recalculate normals once in a "

"Currently there is a problem with zero gravity simulation. It could be "

"If an object is initialized as *Volume*, it has to be closed and have an "
"inner side (a plane will not work). To use planes, switch to *Shell*, or "
"extrude the plane."

"Blender freezes after clicking *bake*. Pressing :kbd:`Esc` makes it work "
"again after a while -- this can happen if the resolution is too high and "
"memory is swapped to a drive, making everything horribly slow. Reducing "
"the resolution should help in this case."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Blender crashes after clicking *bake* -- this can happen if the "
"resolution is really high and more than 2GB are allocated, causing "
"Blender to crash. Reducing the resolution should help in this case. Many "
"operating systems limit the total amount of memory that can be allocated "
"by a *process*, such as Blender, even if the *machine* has more memory "
"installed."

msgid ""
"The meshes should be closed, so if some parts of e.g. a fluid object are "
"not initialized as fluid in the simulation, check that all parts of "
"connected vertices are closed meshes. Unfortunately, the Suzanne (monkey)"
" mesh in Blender is not a closed mesh (the eyes are separate)."

"If the fluid simulation exits with an error message (stating e.g. that "
"the \"init has failed\"), make sure you have valid settings for the "
"domain object, e.g. by resetting them to the defaults."

"Note that first frame may well take only a few hundred MBs of ram-memory,"
" but latter ones go over one GB, which may be why your bake fails after "
"awhile. If so, try to bake one frame at the middle or end at full res so "
"you will see if it works."

"Using \"generate particles\" will also add memory requirements, as they "
"increase surface area and complexity. Ordinary fluid simulations "
"generated particles probably consume less memory."
