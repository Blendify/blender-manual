"Fluid physics are used to simulate physical properties of liquids "
"especially water. While creating a scene in Blender, certain objects can "
"be marked to participate in the fluid simulation. These can include but "
"not limited to, being a fluid or as an obstacle. For a fluid simulation "
"you have to have a domain to define the space that the simulation takes "
"up. In the domain settings you will be able to define the global "
"simulation parameters (such as viscosity and gravity)."

"First you want to set the :doc:`simulation domain "

"Next set the :doc:`fluid source(s) </physics/fluid/types/fluid_object>`, "

"In some cases you may want to set other objects to :doc:`Control the Flow"

#: ../../manual/physics/fluid/introduction.rst:28

"You can also depending on your scene add other objects related to the "
"fluid, like: :doc:`Obstacles </physics/fluid/types/obstacle>`, "
":doc:`Particles </physics/fluid/types/particle>` floating on the fluid."
