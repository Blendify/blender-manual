"All regions of this object that are inside the domain bounding box will "
"be used as actual fluid in the simulation. If you place more than one "
"fluid object inside the domain, they should currently not intersect. Also"
" make sure the surface normals are pointing outwards. In contrast to "
"domain objects, the actual mesh geometry is used for fluid objects."

"Blender uses the orientation of the Surface Normals to determine what is "
"\"inside of\" the Fluid object and what is \"outside\". You want all of "
"the normals to face *outside* (in *Edit Mode*, use :kbd:`Ctrl-N` or press"
" :kbd:`Spacebar` and choose :menuselection:`Edit --> Normals --> "
"Calculate Outside`). If the normals face the wrong way, you will be "
"rewarded with a \"gigantic flood of water\", because Blender will think "
"that the volume of the object is outside of its mesh! This applies "
"regardless of the *Volume initialization* type setting."
