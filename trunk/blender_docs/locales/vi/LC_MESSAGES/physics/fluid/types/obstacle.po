"This object will be used as an obstacle in the simulation. As with a "
"fluid object, obstacle objects currently should not intersect. As for "
"fluid objects, the actual mesh geometry is used for obstacles. For "
"objects with a volume, make sure that the normals of the obstacle are "
"calculated correctly, and radiating properly (use the *Flip Normal* "
"button, in *Edit Mode*, *Mesh Tools* panel, in the Tool Shelf), "
"particularly when using a spinned container. Applying a :doc:`Subdivision"
" Surface Modifier </modeling/modifiers/generate/subsurf>` before baking "
"the simulation could also be a good idea if the mesh is not animated."
