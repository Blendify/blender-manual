"The rigid body simulation can be used to simulate the motion of solid "
"objects. It affects the position and orientation of objects and does not "
"deform them."

msgid ""
"Unlike the other simulations in Blender, the rigid body simulation works "
"closer with the animation system. This means that rigid bodies can be "
"used like regular objects and be part of parent-child relationships, "
"animation constraints and drivers."

"Right now only mesh objects can participate in the rigid body simulation."
" To create rigid bodies, either click on *Rigid Body* button in the "
"*Physics* tab of the Properties editor or use the *Add Active*/*Add "
"Passive* buttons in the *Physics* tab of the *Tool Shelf*."

"There are two types of rigid body: active and passive. *Active* bodies "
"are dynamically simulated, while *passive* bodies remain static. Both "
"types can be driven by the animation system when using the *Animated* "
"option."

msgid ""
"During the simulation, the rigid body system will override the position "
"and orientation of dynamic rigid body objects. Note however, that the "
"location and rotation of the objects are not changed, so the rigid body "
"simulation acts similar to a constraint. To apply the rigid body "
"transformations you can use the *Apply Transformation* button in the "
"*Physics* tab of the *Tool Shelf*."

"The scale of the rigid body object also influences the simulation, but is"
" always controlled by the animation system."

"Rigid body physics on the object can be *removed* with the *Rigid Body* "
