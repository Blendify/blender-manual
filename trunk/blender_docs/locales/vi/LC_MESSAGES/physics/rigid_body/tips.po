"As with all physics-enabled objects, pay close attention to the "
"*Animated* checkbox in the *Rigid Body* panel of the *Physics* tab in the"
" Properties editor. A common mistake is to use keyframe animation on a "
"*Passive* physics object without checking the *Animated* box. The object "
"will move, but the physics engine will behave as if the *Passive* is "
"still in its starting place, leading to disappointment."

"The most common trick is to :term:`keyframe` animate the location or "
"rotation of an *Active* physics object as well as the *Animated* "
"checkbox. When the curve on the *Animated* property switches to disabled,"
" the physics engine takes over using the object's last known location, "
"rotation and velocities."

"Animating the strengths of various other parameters (a :doc:`Motor's "
"</physics/rigid_body/constraints/types/motor>` Target Velocity, a "
":doc:`Hinge's </physics/rigid_body/constraints/types/hinge>` limits, "
"etc.) can be used to accomplish a wide variety of interesting results."

"Enabling a constraint during the physics simulation often has dramatic "
"results as the physics engine tries to bring into alignment two objects "
"which are often dramatically out of alignment. It is very common for the "
"affected objects to build up enough kinetic energy to bounce themselves "
"out of camera (and into orbit, although the physics engine is not yet "
"capable of simulating a planet's gravity well, so scratch that)."

msgid ""
"The simplest way of improving simulation stability is to increase the "
"steps per second. However, care has to be taken since making too many "
"steps can cause problems and make the simulation even less stable (if you"
" need more than 1000 steps, you should look at other ways to improve "
"stability)."

"Increasing the number of solver iterations helps making constraints "
"stronger and also improves object stacking stability."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is best to avoid small objects, as they are currently unstable. "
"Ideally, objects should be at least 20 cm in diameter. If it is still "
"necessary, setting the collision margin to 0, while generally not "
"recommended, can help making small object behave more naturally."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/physics/rigid_body/tips.rst:53
msgid ""
"When objects are small and/or move very fast, they can pass through each "
"other. Besides what is mentioned above it's also good to avoid using mesh"
" shapes in this case. Mesh shapes consist of individual triangles and "
"therefore do not really have any thickness, so objects can pass through "
"more easily. You can give them some thickness by increasing the collision"
" margin."

"Since the rigid body simulation is part of the animation system, it can "
"influence other simulations just like the animation system can."

"In order for this to work, the rigid body object needs to have a "
"Collision Modifier. Simply click on *Collision* in the *Physics* tab."

"If dynamic scaling is not needed, rigid body objects should have the "
"scale applied by using the *Apply Scale* tool :kbd:`Ctrl-A`."
