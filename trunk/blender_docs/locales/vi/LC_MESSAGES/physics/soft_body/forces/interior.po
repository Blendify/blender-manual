"In between each neighboring vertex of a mesh, you typically create edges "
"to connect them. Imagine each edge as a spring. Any mechanical spring is "
"able to stretch under tension, and to squeeze under pressure. All springs"
" have an ideal length, and a stiffness that limits how far you can "
"stretch or squeeze the spring."

msgid ""
"In Blender's case, the ideal length is the original edge length which you"
" designed as a part of your mesh, even before you enable the Soft Body "
"system. Until you add the Soft Body physics, all springs are assumed to "
"be perfectly stiff: no stretch and no squeeze."

"You can adjust the stiffness of all those edge springs, allowing your "
"mesh to sag, to bend, to flutter in the breeze, or to puddle up on the "
"ground."

"To create a connection between the vertices of a soft body object there "
"have to be forces that hold the vertices together. These forces are "
"effective along the edges in a mesh, the connections between the "
"vertices. The forces act like a spring. Fig. :ref:`fig-softbody-force-"
"interior-connection` illustrates how a 3Ã—3 grid of vertices (a mesh plane"
" in Blender) are connected in a soft body simulation."

"But two vertices could freely rotate if you do not create additional "
"edges between them. The logical method to keep a body from collapsing "
"would be to create additional edges between the vertices. This works "
"pretty well, but would change your mesh topology drastically."

"Luckily, Blender allows to define additional *virtual* connections. On "
"one hand you can define virtual connections between the diagonal edges of"
" a quad face (*Stiff Quads* Fig. :ref:`fig-softbody-force-interior-"
"stiff`), on the other hand you can define virtual connections between a "
"vertex and any vertices connected to its neighbors' *Bending Stiffness*. "
"In other words, the amount of bend that is allowed between a vertex and "
"any other vertex that is separated by two edge connections."
