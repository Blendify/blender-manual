"What happens? The cube moves in negative Z direction. Each of its eight "
"vertices is affected by a global, constant force -- the gravitation. "
"Gravitation without friction is independent from the weight of an object,"
" so each object you would use as a soft body here would fall with the "
"same acceleration. The object does not deform, because every vertex moves"
" with the same speed in the same direction."

"This special exterior force is not applied to the vertices but to the "
"connecting edges. Technically, a force perpendicular to the edge is "
"applied. The force scales with the projection of the relative speed on "
"the edge (dot product). Note that the force is the same if wind is "
"blowing or if you drag the edge through the air with the same speed. That"
" means that an edge moving in its own direction feels no force, and an "
"edge moving perpendicular to its own direction feels maximum force."

"The angle and the relative speed between medium and edge is used to "
"calculate the force on the edge. This force results that vertices with "
"few connecting edges (front of a plane) fall faster than vertices with "
"more connecting edges (middle of a plane). If all vertices have the same "
"amount of edges in a direction they fall with equal speed."

"Enabling *Soft Body Goal* tells Blender to use the position (or animated "
"position) of a vertex in the simulation. Animating the vertices can be "
"done in all the usual ways (F-curves, armatures, parents, lattices, etc.)"

"Goal also serves as a memory, to make sure soft objects don't deform too "
"much, ending up in the non-soft animated shape. Using the *Vertex Group* "
"weight system, you can define a *Goal* weight per vertex. To make this "
"look more natural, spring forces can be defined to control how far "
"vertices can move from their original position."

"Often :ref:`painting-weight-index` is used to adjust the weight "
