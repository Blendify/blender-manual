"Soft body simulation is used for simulating soft deformable objects. It "
"was designed primarily for adding secondary motion to animation, like "
"jiggle for body parts of a moving character."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/physics/soft_body/introduction.rst:10
msgid ""
"It also works for simulating more general soft objects that bend, deform "
"and react to forces like gravity and wind, or collide with other objects."

"While it can simulate cloth and other stiff types of deformable objects "
"to an extent, the :doc:`Cloth Simulation </physics/cloth/index>` can do "
"it better with a solver specifically designed for this purpose."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/physics/soft_body/introduction.rst:17
msgid ""
"The simulation works by combining existing animation on the object with "
"forces acting on it. There are exterior forces like gravity or force "
"fields and interior forces that hold the vertices together. This way you "
"can simulate the shapes that an object would take on in reality if it had"
" volume, was filled with something, and was acted on by real forces."

"Soft bodies can interact with other objects through *Collision*. They can"
" interact with themselves through *Self-Collision*."

"The result of the soft body simulation can be converted to a static "
"object. You can also *bake edit* the simulation, i.e. edit intermediate "
"results and run the simulation from there."

"To work with a soft body simulation, you will find it handy to use the "
"Timeline editor. You can change between frames and the simulation will "
"always be shown in the actual state. You can interact in real-time with "
"the simulation, e.g. by moving collision objects or shaking a soft body "
"object."

"You can then select the soft body object while running the simulation and"
" *Apply* the modifier in the *Modifiers* tab of the Properties editor. "

msgid ""
"Soft bodies work especially well if the objects have an even vertex "
"distribution. You need enough vertices for good collisions. You change "
"the deformation (the stiffness) if you add more vertices in a certain "
"region."

"The calculation of collisions may take a long time. If something is not "
"visible, why calculate it?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/physics/soft_body/introduction.rst:92
msgid ""
"To speed up the collision calculation it is often useful to collide with "
"an additional, simpler, invisible, somewhat larger object."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/physics/soft_body/introduction.rst:94
msgid ""
"Use soft bodies only where it makes sense. If you try to cover a body "
"mesh with a tight piece of cloth and animate solely with soft body, you "
"will have no success. Self-collision of soft body hair may be activated, "
"but that is a path that you have to wander alone. We will deal with "
":doc:`Collisions </physics/soft_body/collision>` in detail later."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/physics/soft_body/introduction.rst:99
msgid ""
"Try and use a *Lattice* or a *Curve Guide* soft body instead of the "
"object itself. This may be magnitudes faster."
