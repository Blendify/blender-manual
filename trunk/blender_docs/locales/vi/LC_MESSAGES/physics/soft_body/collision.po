"There are two different collision types that you may use: collision "
"between different objects and internal collision. We should set one thing"
" straight from the start -- the primary targets of the collision "
"calculation are the vertices of a soft body. So if you have too few "
"vertices too few collision takes place. Secondarily, you can use edges "
"and faces to improve the collision calculation."

"If *Collision Group* is set, the object must belong to the group. "

"necessarily have to be visible."

"A soft body cube colliding with a plane (Fig. :ref:`fig-softbody-"
"collision-plane1`) works pretty well, but a soft body plane falls right "
"through a cube that it is supposed to collide with (Fig. :ref:`fig-"
"softbody-collision-plane2`)."

"Why is that? Because the default method of calculation only checks to see"
" if the four vertices of the soft body plane collides with the cube as "
"the plane is pulled down by gravity. You can activate *Collision: Face* "
"(in the *Soft Body Edges* panel) to enable collision between the face of "
"the plane and the object instead, but this type of calculation takes much"
" longer."

"In the video below, you can see the vertices colliding with a plane. If a"
" vertex penetrates the zone between *Outer* and *Inner*, it is repulsed "
"by a force in the direction of the face normal. The position that a "
"vertex finally ends up in is dependent on the forces that act upon it. In"
" the example (the first vertex on the left in the video below) gravity "
"and the repulsion force of the face balance out. The speed at which the "
"vertex is pulled out of the collision zone is influenced by the *Choke* "
"parameter in the :ref:`Soft Body Solver settings <physics-softbody-"
"settings-solver>`."

"Now let's see what happens if we make vertices heavier and let them "
"travel at a faster speed. In the video above, you can see vertices "
"traveling at different speeds. The two on the far right (fifth and sixth)"
" are traveling so fast that they pass right through the collision zone "
"(this is because of the default solver precision, which we can fix "
"later). You will notice that the fourth vertex also travels quite fast "
"and because it is heavier it breaches the inner zone. The first three "
"vertices collide correctly."

"You can set up your collision so that edges and even faces are included "
"in the collision calculation in the *Soft Body Edges* panel with the "
"Collision *Face* and *Edge* options. The collision is then calculated "
"differently. It is checked whether the edge or face intersects with the "
"collision object, the collision zones are not used."
