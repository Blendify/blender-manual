"When Blender carries out operations that require extra memory (RAM), it "
"calls a function called malloc (short for memory allocate) which tries to"
" allocate a requested amount of memory for Blender. If this cannot be "
"satisfied, malloc will return nil/null/0 to indicate that it failed to "
"carry out the request. If this happens Blender will not be able to carry "
"out the operation requested by the user. This will most likely result in "
"Blender operating very slowly or shutting down. If you want to avoid "
"running out of memory you can install more memory in your system, reduce "
"the amount of detail in your Blender models, or shut down other programs "
"and services which may be taking up memory that Blender could use."
