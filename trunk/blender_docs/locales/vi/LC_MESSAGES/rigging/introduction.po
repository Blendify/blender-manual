"Rigging is a general term used for adding controls to objects, typically "
"for the purpose of animation."

"Rigging can be as advanced as your project requires, rigs are effectively"

"A camera rig can be used instead of animating the camera object directly "
"to simulate real-world camera rigs *(with a boom arm, mounted on a "
"rotating pedestal for example, effects such as camera jitter can be added"
" too).*"

"The content of this chapter is simply a reference to how rigging is "
"accomplished in Blender. It should be paired with additional resources "
"such as Nathan Vegdahl's excellent (and free!) introduction to the "
"fundamental concepts of character rigging, `Humane Rigging "
