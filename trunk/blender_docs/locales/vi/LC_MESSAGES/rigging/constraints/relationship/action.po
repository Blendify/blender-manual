"The underlying idea of the *Action* constraint is very similar to the one"
" behind the :doc:`Drivers </animation/drivers/index>`, except that the "
"former uses a whole action (i.e. a bunch of F-Curves of the same type), "
"while the latter controls a single F-curve of their \"owner\"..."

"Note that even if the constraint accepts the *Mesh* action type, only the"
" *Object*, *Pose* and *Constraint* types are really working, as "
"constraints can only affect objects' or bones' transform properties, and "
"not meshes' shapes. Also note that only the object transformation "
"(location, rotation, scale) is affected by the action, if the action "
"contains keyframes for other properties they are ignored, as constraints "
"do not influence those."

"As an example, let us assume you have defined an *Object* action (it can "
"be assigned to any object, or even no object at all), and have mapped it "
"on your owner through an *Action* constraint, so that moving the target "
"in the (0.0 to 2.0) range along its X axis maps the action content on the"
" owner in the (0 to 100) frame range. This will mean that when the "
"target's *X* property is 0.0 the owner will be as if in frame 0 of the "
"linked action; with the target's *X* property at 1.0 the owner will be as"
" if in frame 50 of the linked action, etc."
