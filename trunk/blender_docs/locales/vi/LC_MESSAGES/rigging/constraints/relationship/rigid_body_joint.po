"The *Rigid Body Joint* constraint is very special, it is used by the "
"physics part of the Blender Game Engine to simulate a joint between its "
"owner and its target. It offers four joint types: hinge type, ball-and-"
"socket type, cone-twist type, and generic six-\\ :abbr:`DoF (Degrees of "
"Freedom)` type."

"The joint point and axes are defined and fixed relative to the owner. The"
" target moves as if it were stuck to the center point of a stick, the "
"other end of the stick rotating around the joint/pivot point..."

"This constraint is of no use in most \"standard\" static or animated "
"projects. However, you can use its results outside of the BGE, through "
"the :menuselection:`Game --> Record Animation`. (see :doc:`Rigid Bodies "
"</game_engine/physics/converting>` for more info on this topic)."
