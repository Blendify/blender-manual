"Do not confuse this \"basic\" object parenting with the one that defines "
"the :ref:`chains of bones <armature-bone-chain>` inside of an armature. "
"This constraint is used to parent an object to a bone (the so-called "
":doc:`object skinning "
"</editors/3dview/object/properties/relations/parents>`), or even bones to"
" bones. But do not try to use it to define chains of bones."

msgid ""
"By default, when you parent your owner to your target, the target becomes"
" the origin of the owner's space. This means that the location, rotation "
"and scale of the owner are offset by the same properties of the target. "
"In other words, the owner is transformed when you parent it to your "
"target. This might not be desired! So, if you want to restore your owner "
"to its before-parenting state, click on the *Set Inverse* button."

#: ../../manual/rigging/constraints/relationship/child_of.rst:61
msgid ""
"When creating a new parent relationship using this constraint, it is "
"usually necessary to click on the *Set Inverse* button after assigning "
"the parent. As noted above, this cancels out any unwanted transform from "
"the parent, so that the owner returns to the location/rotation/scale it "
"was in before the constraint was applied. Note that you should apply *Set"
" Inverse* with all other constraints disabled (their *Influence* set to "
"0.0) for a particular *Child Of* constraint, and before transforming the "
"target/parent (see example below)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/rigging/constraints/relationship/child_of.rst:69
msgid ""
"About the toggle buttons that control which target's (i.e. parent's) "
"individual transform properties affect the owner, it is usually best to "
"leave them all enabled, or to disable all three of the given Location, "
"Rotation and Scale transforms."

msgid "Technical Note"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/rigging/constraints/relationship/child_of.rst:78
msgid ""
"If you use this constraint with all channels on, it will use a straight "
"matrix multiplication for the parent relationship, not decomposing the "
"parent matrix into loc/rot/size. This ensures any transformation "
"correctly gets applied, also for combinations of rotated and non-uniform "
"scaled parents."
