"An object or *unconnected* bone can be moved around the scene along the "
"X, Y and Z axes. This constraint restricts the amount of allowed "
"translations along each axis, through lower and upper bounds."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The limits for an object are calculated from its center, and the limits "
"of a bone, from its root."

msgid ""
"It is interesting to note that even though the constraint limits the "
"visual and rendered location of its owner, its owner's data-block still "
"allows (by default) the object or bone to have coordinates outside the "
"minimum and maximum ranges. This can be seen in its *Transform* panel."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/rigging/constraints/transform/limit_location.rst:19
msgid ""
"When an owner is grabbed and attempted to be moved outside the limit "
"boundaries, it will be constrained to those boundaries visually and when "
"rendered, but internally, its coordinates will still be changed beyond "
"the limits. If the constraint is removed, its ex-owner will seem to jump "
"to its internally specified location."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/rigging/constraints/transform/limit_location.rst:24
msgid ""
"Similarly, if its owner has an internal location that is beyond the "
"limits, dragging it back into the limit area will appear to do nothing "
"until the internal coordinates are back within the limit threshold "
"(unless you enabled the *For Transform* option, see below)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Setting equal the min and max values of an axis, locks the owner's "
"movement along that axis... Although this is possible, using the "
"*Transformation Properties* axis locking feature is probably easier!"

"These buttons enable the lower boundary for the location of the owner's "
"center along, respectively, the X, Y and Z axes of the chosen *Space*. "
"The number button below them controls the value of their limit. Note that"
" if a min value is higher than its corresponding max value, the "
"constraint behaves as if it had the same value as the max one."

"We saw that by default, even though visually constrained, the owner can "
"still have coordinates out of bounds (as shown by the *Transform* panel)."
" Well, when you enable this button, this is no longer possible -- the "
"owner's transform properties are also limited by the constraint. Note "
"however, that the constraint does not directly modify the coordinates: "
"you have to grab its owner one way or another for this to take effect..."
