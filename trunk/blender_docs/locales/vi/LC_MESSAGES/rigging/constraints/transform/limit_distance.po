"The *Limit Distance* constraint forces its owner to stay either further "
"from, nearer to, or exactly at a given distance from its target. In other"
" words, the owner's location is constrained either outside, inside, or at"
" the surface of a sphere centered on its target."

"When you specify a (new) target, the *Distance* value is automatically "
