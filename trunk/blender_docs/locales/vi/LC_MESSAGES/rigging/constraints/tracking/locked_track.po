"The *Locked Track* constraint is a bit tricky to explain, both "
"graphically and textual. Basically, it is a :doc:`Track To constraint "
"</rigging/constraints/tracking/track_to>`, but with a locked axis, i.e. "
"an axis that cannot rotate (change its orientation). Hence, the owner can"
" only track its target by rotating around this axis, and unless the "
"target is in the plane perpendicular to the locked axis, and crossing the"
" owner, this owner cannot really point at its target."

msgid ""
"Let us take the best real-world equivalent: a compass. It can rotate to "
"point in the general direction of its target (the magnetic North, or a "
"neighbor magnet), but it cannot point *directly at it*, because it spins "
"like a wheel on an axle. If a compass is sitting on a table and there is "
"a magnet directly above it, the compass cannot point to it. If we move "
"the magnet more to one side of the compass, it still cannot point *at* "
"the target, but it can point in the general direction of the target, and "
"still obey its restrictions of the axle."

"When using a *Locked Track* constraint, you can think of the target as a "
"magnet, and the owner as a compass. The *Lock* axis will function as the "
"axle around which the owner spins, and the *To* axis will function as the"
" compass' needle. Which axis does what is up to you!"

"If you have trouble understanding the buttons of this constraint, read "
"the tooltips, they are pretty good. If you do not know where your "
"object's axes are, turn on the *Axis* button in the *Object* menu's "
"*Draw* panel. Or, if you are working with bones, turn on the *Axes* "
"button in the *Armature* menu's *Display* panel."

"This constraint was designed to work cooperatively with the *Track To* "
"constraint. If you set the axes buttons right for these two constraints, "
"*Track To* can be used to point the axle at a primary target, and *Locked"
" Track* can spin the owner around that axle to a secondary target."
