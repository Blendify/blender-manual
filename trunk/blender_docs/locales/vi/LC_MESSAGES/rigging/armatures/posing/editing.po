"The \"transform center\" of a given bone (i.e. its default pivot point, "

"some pivot point options seem to not work properly. In fact, except for "
"the *3D Cursor* one, all others appear to always use the median point of "

"Moreover, the local space for these actions is the bone's own one "
"(visible when you enable the *Axes* option of the *Armature* panel). This"
" is especially important when using axis locking, for example, there is "
"no specific \"bone roll\" tool in *Pose Mode*, as you can rotate around "

"When you pose your armature, you are supposed to have one or more objects"

"its related objects or object's shape is moved/deformed accordingly, in "
"real-time. Unfortunately, if you have a complex rig set-up and/or a heavy"
" skin object, this might produce lag, and make interactive editing very "
"painful. If you experience such troubles, try enabling the *Delay Deform*"
" button of the *Armature* panel the skin objects will only be updated "
