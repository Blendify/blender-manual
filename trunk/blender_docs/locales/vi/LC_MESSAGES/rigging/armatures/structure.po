"Armatures mimic real skeletons. They are made out of bones, which are (by"
" default) rigid elements. But you have more possibilities than with real "
"skeletons: In addition to the \"natural\" rotation of bones, you can also"
" translate and even scale them! And your bones do not have to be "
"connected to each other; they can be completely free if you want. "
"However, the most natural and useful setups imply that some bones are "
"related to others, forming so-called \"chains of bones\", which create "
"some sort of \"limbs\" in your armature, as detailed in `Chains of "
"Bones`_."

"The bones inside an armature can be completely independent from each "
"other (i.e. the modification of one bone does not affect the others). But"
" this is not often a useful set up: To create a leg, all bones \"after\" "
"the thigh bone should move \"with\" it in a well-coordinated manner. This"
" is exactly what happens in armatures by parenting a bone to the next one"
" in the limb, you create a \"chains of bones\". These chains can be "
"ramified. For example, five fingers attached to a single \"hand\" bone."

"Bones are chained by linking the tip of the parent to the root of the "
"child. Root and tip can be *connected*, i.e. they are always exactly at "
"the same point; or they can be *free*, like in a standard parent-child "
"object relationship."

"A given bone can be the parent of several children, and hence be part of "
"several chains at the same time."

"The bone at the beginning of a chain is called its *root bone*, and the "
"last bone of a chain is the *tip bone* (do not confuse them with similar "
"names of bones' joints!)."

msgid ""
"Chains of bones are a particularly important topic in :doc:`posing "
"</rigging/armatures/posing/index>` (especially with the standard *forward"
" kinematics* versus \"automatic\" *inverse kinematics* posing "
"techniques). You create/edit them in *Edit Mode*, but except in case of "
"connected bones, their relationships have no effect on bone "
"transformations in this mode (i.e. transforming a parent bone will not "
"affect its children)."

"The easiest way to manage bones relationships is to use the "
