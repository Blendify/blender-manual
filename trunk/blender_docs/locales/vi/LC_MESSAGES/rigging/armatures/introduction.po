"An Armature in Blender can be thought of as similar to the armature of a "
"real skeleton, and just like a real skeleton an Armature can consist of "
"many bones. These bones can be moved around and anything that they are "
"attached to or associated with will move and deform in a similar way."

"An \"armature\" is a type of object used for :doc:`rigging "
"</rigging/index>`. A rig is the controls and strings that move a "
"marionette (puppet). Armature object borrows many ideas from real-world "
"skeletons."
