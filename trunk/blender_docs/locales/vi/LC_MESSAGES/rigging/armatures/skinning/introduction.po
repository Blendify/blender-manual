"We have seen in :doc:`previous pages </rigging/armatures/index>` how to "
"design an armature, create chains of bones, etc. Now, having a good rig "
"is not the final goal, unless you want to produce a \"Dance Macabre\" "
"animation, you will likely want to put some flesh on your skeletons! "
"Surprisingly, \"linking\" an armature to the object(s) it should "
"transform and/or deform is called the \"skinning\" process..."

"You can :doc:`Parent/Constrain Objects to Bones "

"transform the bones in *Pose Mode*, their \"children\" objects are also "
"transformed, exactly as with a standard parent/children relationship... "
"The \"children\" are **never** deformed when using this method."

"You can :doc:`Use the Armature Modifier on entire Mesh "
"</rigging/armatures/skinning/parenting>`, and then, some parts of this "
"object to some bones inside this armature. This is the more complex and "
"powerful method, and the only way to really deform the geometry of the "
"object, i.e. to modify its vertices/control points relative positions."
