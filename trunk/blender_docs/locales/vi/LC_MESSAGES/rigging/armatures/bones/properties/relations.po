"Connected bones have another specificity: they cannot be translated. "
"Indeed, as their root must be at their parent's tip, if you do not move "
"the parent, you cannot move the child's root, but only its tip, which "
"leads to a child rotation. This is exactly what happens, when you press "
":kbd:`G` with a connected bone selected, Blender automatically switches "
"to rotation operation."

"(see Fig. :ref:`fig-rig-pose-edit-scale` the third tip bone, outlined in "

"So, when posing a chain of bones, you should always edit its elements "
"from the root bone to the tip bone. This process is known as *forward "
"kinematics* (FK). We will see in a :ref:`later page <bone-constraints-"
"inverse-kinematics>` that Blender features another pose method, called "
"*inverse kinematics* (IK), which allows you to pose a whole chain just by"
