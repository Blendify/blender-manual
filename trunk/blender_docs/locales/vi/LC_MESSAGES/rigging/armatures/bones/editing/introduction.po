"The set of bone editing tools is quite similar to the one for :doc:`mesh "
"</modeling/meshes/editing/introduction>` editing. Blender also features a"
" more advanced \"armature sketching\" tool, called :doc:`Etch-a-Ton "
"</rigging/armatures/bones/editing/sketching/introduction>`. The same tool"
" might also be used in :ref:`templating <rigging-armatures-bones-editing-"
"sketching-converting-templating>`, i.e. using another armature as "
"template for the current one..."

"One important thing to understand about armature editing is that you edit"
" the *rest position* of your armature, i.e. its \"default state\". An "
"armature in its *rest position* has all bones with *no* rotation and "
"scaled to 1.0 in their own local space."

"The different :doc:`poses </rigging/armatures/posing/index>` you might "
"create afterwards are based on this rest position. So if you modify it in"
" *Edit Mode*, all the poses already existing will also be modified. Thus "
"you should in general be sure that your armature is definitive before "
"starting to :doc:`skin </rigging/armatures/skinning/index>` and "
":doc:`pose </rigging/armatures/posing/index>` it!"
