"The purpose of a Keyframe is to allow for interpolated animation, "
"meaning, for example, that the user could then add another key on frame "
"10, specifying the cube's horizontal position at 20m, and Blender will "
"automatically determine the correct position of the cube for all the "
"frames between frame 1 and 10 depending on the chosen interpolation "
"method (e.g. Linear, BÃ©zier, Quadratic, etc.)."
