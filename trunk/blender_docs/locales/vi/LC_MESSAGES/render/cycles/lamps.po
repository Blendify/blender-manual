"Next to lighting from the background and any object with an emission "
"shader, lamps are another way to add light into the scene. The difference"
" is that they are not directly visible in the rendered image, and can be "
"more easily managed as objects of their own type."

"For the branch path tracing integrator, this specifies the number of "

"By default lamps use only direct light sampling. For area lights and "

msgid ""
"Point lamps emit light equally in all directions. By setting the *Size* "

msgid ""
"Spot lamps emit light in a particular direction, inside a cone. By "
"setting the *Size* larger than zero, they can cast softer shadows and "
"shading. The size parameter defines the size of the cone, while the blend"
" parameter can soften the edges of the cone."

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/lamps.rst:85
msgid ""
"Area lamps can also function as light portals to help sample the "
"environment light, and significantly reduce noise in interior scenes. "
"Note that rendering with portals is usually slower, but as it converges "
"more quickly, less samples are required."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/lamps.rst:89
msgid ""
"Light portals work by enabling the *Portal* option, and placing areas "
"lamps in windows, door openings, and any place where light will enter the"
" interior."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/lamps.rst:92
msgid ""
"In outdoor scenes most rays do not bounce much and just fly off into the "
"sky and therefore, light portals are not helpful for outdoor scenes."

msgid ""
"Sun lamps emit light in a given direction. Their position is not taken "
"into account; they are always located outside of the scene, infinitely "
"far away, and will not result in any distance falloff."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/lamps.rst:108
msgid ""
"Because they are not located inside the scene, their strength uses "
"different units, and should typically be set to lower values than other "
"lights."
