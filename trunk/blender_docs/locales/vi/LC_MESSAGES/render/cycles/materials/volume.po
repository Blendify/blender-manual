"To set up a volume, you create a mesh that defines the bounds within "
"which the volume exists. In the material you typically remove the surface"
" nodes and instead connect volume nodes to define the shading inside the "
"volume. For effects such as absorption in glass you can use both a "
"surface and volume shader. The world can also use a volume shader to "
"create effects such as mist."

"</render/cycles/nodes/types/shaders/volume_principled>` is a physically-"
"based volume shader that can be used to create a wide range of volume "
"materials. It supports scattering, absorption and emission in one easy to"

":doc:`Volume Absorption "

"of the light as it passes through the volume. This can be used to shade "
"for example black smoke or colored glass objects, or mixed with the "
"volume scatter node. This node is similar to the transparent BSDF node, "
"it blocks part of the light and lets other light pass straight through."

":doc:`Volume Scatter </render/cycles/nodes/types/shaders/volume_scatter>`"
" lets light scatter in other directions as it hits particles in the "
"volume. The anisotropy defines in which direction the light is more "
"likely to scatter. A value of 0 will let light scatter evenly in all "
"directions (similar to the diffuse BSDF node), negative values let light "
"scatter mostly backwards, and positive values let light scatter mostly "
"forward. This can be used to shade white smoke or clouds for example."

msgid ""
"When rendering smoke and fire, volume attributes are used to define the "

"them by default, while custom volume shaders can use the Attribute node "
"to get attributes such as density, color and temperature."

msgid "Density"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/materials/volume.rst:68
msgid ""
"All volume shaders have a density input. The density defines how much of "
"the light will interact with the volume, getting absorbed or scattered, "
"and how much will pass straight through. For effects such as smoke you "
"would specify a density field to indicate where in the volume there is "
"smoke and how much (density bigger than 0), and where there is no smoke "
"(density equals 0)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/materials/volume.rst:74
msgid ""
"Volumes in the real world consist of particles, a higher density means "
"there are more particles per unit volume. More particles means there is a"
" higher chance for light to collide with a particle and get absorbed or "
"scattered, rather than passing straight through."

msgid ""
"Meshes used for volume render should be closed and :term:`manifold`. That"
" means that there should be no holes in the mesh. Each edge must be "
"connected to exactly two faces such that there are no holes or T-shaped "
"faces where three or more faces are connected to an edge."

"Normals must point outside for correct results. The normals are used to "
"determine if a ray enters or exits a volume, and if they point in a wrong"
" direction, or there is a hole in the mesh, then the renderer is unable "

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/materials/volume.rst:102
msgid ""
"Currently, this is most useful for night time or other dark scenes, as "
"the world surface shader or sun lamps will have no effect if a volume "
"shader is used. This is because the world background is assumed to be "
"infinitely far away, which is accurate enough for the sun for example. "
"However, for modeling effects such as fog or atmospheric scattering, it "
"is not a good assumption that the volume fills the entire space, as most "
"of the distance between the sun and the earth is empty space. For such "
"effects it is be better to create a volume object surrounding the scene. "
"The size of this object will determine how much light is scattered or "
"absorbed."

msgid "Multiple Scattering"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/materials/volume.rst:116
msgid ""
"Real-world effects such as scattering in clouds or subsurface scattering "
"require many scattering bounces. However, unbiased rendering of such "
"effects can be noisy, so by default the number of bounces is zero. The "
"effect you get when rendering with zero volume bounces is what is known "
"as \"single scattering\", the effect from more bounces is \"multiple "
"scattering\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/materials/volume.rst:122
msgid ""
"For rendering materials like skin or milk that require multiple "
"scattering, subsurface scattering is more efficient and easier to "
"control. Particularly the random walk method can accurately render such "
"materials."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/materials/volume.rst:126
msgid ""
"For materials such as clouds or smoke that do not have a well defined "
"surface, volume rendering is required. These look best with many "
"scattering bounces, but in practice one might have to limit the number of"
" bounces to keep render times acceptable."
