msgid ""
"The maximum number of light bounces can be controlled manually. While "
"ideally this should be infinite, in practice a smaller number of bounces "
"may be sufficient, or some light interactions may be intentionally left "
"out for faster convergence. The number of diffuse reflection, glossy "
"reflection and transmission bounces can also be controlled individually."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/settings/scene/render/light_paths.rst:44
msgid ""
"Light paths are terminated probabilistically when specifying a minimum "
"number of light bounces lower than the maximum. In that case paths longer"
" than minimum will be randomly stopped when they are expected to "
"contribute less light to the image. This will still converge to the same "
"image, but renders faster while possibly being noisier."

"A common source of noise is caustics, which are diffuse bounces followed "
"by a glossy bounce (assuming we start from the camera). An option is "
"available to disable these entirely."

msgid ""
"The transparent :abbr:`BSDF (Bidirectional scattering distribution "
"function)` shader is given special treatment. When a ray passes through "
"it, light passes straight on, as if there was no geometry there. The ray "
"type does not change when passing through a transparent BSDF."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/settings/scene/render/light_paths.rst:63
msgid ""
"Alpha pass output is also different for the transparent BSDF. Other "
"transmission BSDFs are considered opaque, because they change the light "
"direction. As such they cannot be used for alpha-over compositing, while "
"this is possible with the transparent BSDF."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/settings/scene/render/light_paths.rst:68
msgid ""
"The maximum number of transparent bounces is controlled separately from "
"other bounces. It is also possible to use probabilistic termination of "
"transparent bounces, which might help rendering many layers of "
"transparency."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/settings/scene/render/light_paths.rst:72
msgid ""
"Note that while semantically the ray passes through as if no geometry was"
" hit, rendering performance is affected as each transparency step "
"requires executing the shader and tracing a ray."
