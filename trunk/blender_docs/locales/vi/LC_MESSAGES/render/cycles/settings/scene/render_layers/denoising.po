"To use the option, enable it in the render layers tab of the Properties "
"editor. On rendering, it will denoise tile by tile once all the "
"surrounding tiles are finished rendering. The default settings fit a wide"

"the trade-off between a noise-free image, image details, and calculation "
"time."

"Setting the radius too high is generally not advisable. It increases "
"denoising time a lot and, while the result might be smoother, it is not "
"more accurate since there isn't any additional info coming out of the "
"renderer. Beyond a radius of ~15, the additional rendering time is "
"probably better spent on increasing the amount of samples."

"For animation denoising can be used, however it still requires high "
