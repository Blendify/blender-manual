"Color management is one of the most important tools that an artist can "
"use. It allows an artist to make sure that an image stays the same from "
"rendering, to saving, to post-processing. Color management also allows an"
" artist to tweak things like exposure, gamma, or the overall color grade."

"To achieve color management in Blender, the `OpenColorIO "

"Blender. This library offers fine control over different :abbr:`LUT (Look"

"For correct results, different :term:`color spaces <color space>` are "

"If the colors are linear, it means that if in reality, we double the "
"number of photons, the color values are also doubled. Put another way, if"
" we have two photos/renders each with one of two lights on, and add those"
" images together, the result would be the same as a render/photo with "
"both lights on. It follows that such a radiometrically linear space is "
"best for photorealistic rendering and compositing."

"However, these values do not directly correspond to human perception or "

"There is also an artistic choice to be made for renders. Partially that "
