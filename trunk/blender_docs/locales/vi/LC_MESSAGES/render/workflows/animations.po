msgid ""
"While rendering stills will allow you to view and save the image from the"
" render buffer when it is complete, animations are a series of images, or"
" frames, and are automatically saved directly out to a drive after being "
"rendered."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/workflows/animations.rst:10
msgid ""
"After rendering the frames, you may need to edit the clips, or first use "
"the Compositor to do green-screen masking, matting, color correction, "
"DOF, and so on to the images. That result is then fed to the Sequencer "
"where the strips are cut and mixed and a final overlay is done."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/workflows/animations.rst:15
msgid ""
"Finally you can render out from the Sequencer and compress the frames "
"into a playable movie clip."

msgid "Workflow"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/workflows/animations.rst:21
msgid ""
"Generally, you do a lot of intermediate renders of different frames in "
"your animation to check for timing, lighting, placement, materials, and "
"so on. At some point, you are ready to make a final render of the "
"complete animation for publication."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/workflows/animations.rst:25
msgid ""
"There are two approaches you can use when making a movie, or animation, "
"with or without sound. The approach you should use depends on the amount "
"of CPU time you will need to render the movie. You can render a "
"\"typical\" frame at the desired resolution, and then multiply by the "
"number of frames that will ultimately go into the movie, to arrive at a "
"total render time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/workflows/animations.rst:30
msgid ""
"If the total render time is an hour or more, you want to use the \"Frame "
"Sequence\" approach. For example, if you are rendering a one-minute video"
" clip for film, there will be (60 seconds per minute) X (24 frames per "
"second) or 1440 frames per minute. If each frame takes 30 seconds to "
"render, then you will be able to render two frames per minute, or need "
"720 minutes (12 hours) of render time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/workflows/animations.rst:37
msgid ""
"Rendering takes all available CPU time; you should render overnight, when"
" the computer is not needed, or set Blender to a low priority while "
"rendering, and work on other things (be careful with the RAM space!)."

msgid "Direct Approach"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/workflows/animations.rst:44
msgid ""
"The Direct Approach, which is highly **not** recommended and not a "
"standard practice, is where you set your output format to an AVI or MOV "
"format, and click *Animation* to render your scene directly out to a "
"movie file. Blender creates one file that holds all the frames of your "
"animation. You can then use Blender's VSE to add an audio track to the "
"animation and render out to an MPEG format to complete your movie."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/workflows/animations.rst:53
msgid "Frame Sequence"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/workflows/animations.rst:54
msgid ""
"The Frame Sequence is a much more stable approach, where you set your "
"output format to a still format (such as JPG, PNG or a multi-layer "
"format), and click *Animation* to render your scene out to a set of "
"images, where each image is a frame in the sequence."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/workflows/animations.rst:59
msgid ""
"Blender creates a file for each frame of the animation. You can then use "
"Blender's compositor to perform any frame manipulation (post-processing)."
" You can then use Blender's VSE to load that final image sequence, add an"
" audio track to the animation, and render out to an MPEG format to "
"complete your movie. The Frame Sequence approach is a little more "
"complicated and takes more drive space, but gives you more flexibility."

" to finish rendering the frames."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/workflows/animations.rst:103
msgid ""
"Once the animation is finished, use your OS file explorer to navigate "
"into the output folder (``render`` in this example). You will see lots of"
" images (``.png`` or ``.exr``, etc. depending on the format you chose to "
"render) that have a sequence number attached to them ranging from 0000 to"
" a max of 9999. These are your single frames."

msgid ""
"The :doc:`VSE </editors/vse/index>` does not support multi-layer EXR "

msgid ""
"Why go through all this hassle? Well, first of all, if you render out "
"single frames, you can stop the render at any time by pressing :kbd:`Esc`"
" in the render window or UV/Image editor. You will not lose the frames "
"you have already rendered, since they have been written out to individual"
" files. You can always adjust the range you want to continue from where "
"you left off."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/workflows/animations.rst:131
msgid ""
"You can edit the frames afterwards and post-process them. You can add "
"neat effects in the Sequence editor. You can render the same sequence "
"into different resolutions (640×480, 320×240, etc.) and use different "
"codecs (to get different file sizes and quality) with almost no effort "
"whatsoever."

msgid ""
"Unless your animation renders in a few minutes, it is best to render the "
"animation as separate image files. Instead of rendering directly to a "
"compressed movie file, use a lossless format (e.g. ``PNG``)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/workflows/animations.rst:146
msgid ""
"This allows you an easy recovery if there is a problem and you have to "
"re-start the rendering, since the frames you have already rendered will "

"Using an image format for output, you can use the *Frame Step* option to "
