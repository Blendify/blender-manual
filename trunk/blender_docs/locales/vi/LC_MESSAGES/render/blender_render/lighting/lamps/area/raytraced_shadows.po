"This have the same role as with other lamps, but when using a *Rectangle*"

"*Constant Jittered* sample generator method, this is more or less "
"equivalent to the number of virtual lamps in the area. With QMC sample "

" It artificially softens the borders of shadows; when *Samples* is set "

"\"(a)\" is the *Area* light as defined in Blender. If its shape is "

"You will note that changing the *Size* parameter of your area lamp does "
"not affect the lighting intensity of your scene. On the other hand, "
"rescaling the lamp using the :kbd:`S` in the 3D View could dramatically "
"increase or decrease the lighting intensity of the scene. This behavior "
"has been coded this way so that you can fine-tune all your light settings"
" and then decide to scale up (or down) the whole scene without suffering "
"from a drastic change in the lighting intensity. If you only want to "
"change the dimensions of your *Area* lamp, without messing with its "
"lighting intensity, you are strongly encouraged to use the *Size* "
"button(s) instead."

"If your computer is not very fast, when using the *Constant Jittered* "
"sample generator method, you could find it useful to set a low *Samples* "
"value (like 2) and activate *Umbra*, *Dither*, and/or *Jitter* in order "
"to simulate slightly softer shadows. However, these results will never be"
" better than the same lighting with high *Samples* values."
