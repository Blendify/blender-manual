"*Spot* lights also can produce \"volumetric\" effects. See "
":doc:`Volumetric Light "

"The *Halo* button allows a *Spot* lamp to have a volumetric effect "
"applied to it. This button must be active if the volumetric effect is to "
"be visible. Note that if you are using buffered shadows, you will have "
"extra options described in the :doc:`Spot Buffered Shadows "
"</render/blender_render/lighting/lamps/spot/buffered_shadow>` page."

"The *Intensity* slider controls how intense/dense the volumetric effect "
"is that is generated from the light source. The lower the value of the "
"*Intensity* slider, the less visible the volumetric effect is, while "
"higher *Intensity* values give a much more noticeable and dense "
"volumetric effect."

msgid ""
"This field can have a value between (0 to 12). It is used to determine "
"whether this *Spot* will cast volumetric shadows, and what quality those "
"volumetric shadows will have. If *Step* is set to a value of 0, then no "
"volumetric shadow will be generated. Unlike most other controls, as the "
"*Step* value increases, the quality of volumetric shadows decreases (but "
"take less time to render), and *vice versa*."

"A value of 8 for *Halo Step* is usually a good compromise between speed "

msgid ""
"Blender only simulates volumetric lighting in *Spot* lamps when using its"
" internal renderer. This can lead to some strange results for certain "
"combinations of settings for the light's *Energy* and the halo's "
"*Intensity*. For example, having a *Spot* light with null or very low "
"light *Energy* settings but a very high halo *Intensity* setting can "
"result in a dark/black halo, which would not happen in the real world. "
"Just be aware of this possibility when using halos with the internal "
"renderer."

"The halo effect can be greatly enhanced when using buffered shadows: when"
" the halo's *Step* is not null, they can create \"volumetric shadows\". "
"See the page about *Spot* :doc:`Buffered Shadows "
