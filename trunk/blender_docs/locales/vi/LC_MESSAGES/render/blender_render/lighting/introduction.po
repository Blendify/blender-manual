"Lighting is a very important topic in rendering, standing equal to "
"modeling, materials and textures. The most accurately modeled and "
"textured scene will yield poor results without a proper lighting scheme, "
"while a simple model can become very realistic if skillfully lit."

"The physics of light bouncing around in the real world is simulated by "
"Ambient Occlusion (a world setting), buffer shadows (which approximate "
"shadows being cast by objects), ray tracing (which traces the path of "
"photons from a light source). Also, within Blender you can use "
":doc:`Indirect lighting "
"</render/blender_render/world/indirect_lighting>`. Ray tracing, ambient "
"occlusion, and indirect lighting are computationally intensive processes."
" Blender can perform much faster rendering with its internal scan line "
"renderer, which is a very good scan line renderer indeed. This kind of "
"rendering engine is much faster since it does not try to simulate the "
"real behavior of light, assuming many simplifying hypotheses."

"In this user manual we have placed Lighting before Materials; you should "

" material shaders react to light, without proper lighting, the material "
"shaders will not look right, and you will end up fighting the shaders, "
"when it is really the bad lighting that is causing you grief. All of the "
"example images in this section do not use any material setting at all on "
