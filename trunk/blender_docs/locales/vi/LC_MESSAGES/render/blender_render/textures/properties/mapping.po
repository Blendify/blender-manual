"Textures need mapping coordinates, to determine how they are applied to "

"For example, a 2D image texture could be configured to wrap itself around"

"UV mapping is a very precise way of mapping a 2D texture to a 3D surface."
" Each vertex of a mesh has its own UV coordinates which can be unwrapped "
"and laid flat like a skin. You can almost think of UV coordinates as a "
"mapping that works on a 2D plane with its own local coordinate system to "
"the plane on which it is operating on. This mapping is especially useful "
"when using 2D images as textures, as seen in :ref:`UV Mapping <editors-"
"uv-image-index>`. You can use multiple textures with one set of UV "
"coordinates."

"Flat mapping gives the best results on single planar faces. It does "

"Tube mapping maps the texture around an object like a label on a bottle. "

"When you map no texture axis (i.e. the three \"void\" buttons are set), "
