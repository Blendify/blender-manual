"Environment maps take a render of the 3D scene and apply it to a texture,"
" to use for faking reflections. If you want to achieve a very realistic "
"result, ray-traced reflections are a good solution. Environment Maps are "
"another way to create reflective surfaces, but they are not so simple to "
"set up."

"The main reason is probably that they can be much faster than ray tracing"

"precalculated Environment Map in an image editor."

"Environment maps can also be blurred and render even faster because the "

"Just as we render the light that reaches the viewing plane using the "
"camera to define a viewpoint, we can render the light that reaches the "
"surface of an object (and hence, the light that might ultimately be "
"reflected to the camera). Blender's environment mapping renders a cubic "
"image map of the scene in the six cardinal directions from any point. "
"When the six tiles of the image are mapped onto an object using the "
"*Reflection* input coordinates, they create the visual complexity that "
"the eye expects to see from shiny reflections."

"It is useful to remember here that the true goal of this technique is "

"expects. The most unbelievable thing about most rendered images is the "
"sterility, not the inaccuracy."
