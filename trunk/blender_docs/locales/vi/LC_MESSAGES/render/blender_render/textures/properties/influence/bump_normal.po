msgid ""
"*Normal Maps* and *Bump Maps* both serve the same purpose: they simulate "
"the impression of a detailed 3D surface, by modifying the shading as if "
"the surface had lots of small angles, rather than being completely flat. "
"Because it is just modifying the shading of each pixel, this will not "
"cast any shadows and will not obstruct other objects. If the camera angle"
" is too flat to the surface, you will notice that the surface is not "
"really shaped."

msgid ""
"Both *Bump Maps* and *Normal Maps* work by modifying the normal angle "
"(the direction pointing perpendicular from a face), which influences how "
"a pixel is shaded. Although the terms *Normal Map* and *Bump Map* are "
"often used synonymously, there are certain differences."

msgid ""
"These are textures that store an *intensity*, the relative height of "
"pixels from the viewpoint of the camera. The pixels seem to be moved by "
"the required distance in the direction of the face normals. (The \"bump\""
" consists only of a displacement, which takes place along the existing, "
"and unchanged, normal vector of the face). You may either use grayscale "
"pictures or the intensity values of an RGB texture (including images)."

msgid ""
"These are images that store a *direction*, the direction of normals "
"directly in the RGB values of an image. They are much more accurate, as "
"rather than only simulating the pixel being away from the face along a "
"line, they can simulate that pixel being moved at any direction, in an "
"arbitrary way. The drawbacks to normal maps are that unlike bump maps, "
"which can easily be painted by hand, normal maps usually have to be "
"generated in some way, often from higher resolution geometry than the "
"geometry you are applying the map to."

"Since normals all point towards a viewer, negative Z values are not "
"stored (they would be invisible anyway). In Blender we store a full blue "
"range, although some other implementations also map blue colors (128 - "
"255) to (0.0 - 1.0). The latter convention is used in \"Doom 3\" for "
"example."
