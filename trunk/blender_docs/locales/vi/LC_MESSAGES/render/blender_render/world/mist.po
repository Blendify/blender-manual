msgid ""
"Mist can greatly enhance the illusion of depth in your rendering. To "
"create mist, Blender makes objects farther away more transparent "
"(decreasing their Alpha value) so that they mix more of the background "
"color with the object color. With Mist enabled, the further the object is"
" away from the camera the less its alpha value will be."

"Because *Mist* works by adjusting transparency, this can sometimes cause "
"objects to be partially transparent when they should not be. One "
"workaround is to set the Mist settings as desired, but turn Mist off. The"
" Mist data is still available for compositing even though it is off. Use "
":doc:`Do Composite </compositing/index>` and the :doc:`Node Editor "
"</editors/node_editor/index>` to feed the Mist pass to an :doc:`Alpha "
"Over </compositing/types/color/alpha_over>` to blend the background color"
" (or a render layer with just the sky) with the rendered image. This "
"produces the mist effect but since Mist is off the object transparency "
"(or lack of) is preserved."
