"The TV standards prescribe that there should be 25 frames per second "
"(PAL) or 30 frames per second (NTSC). Since the phosphors of the screen "
"do not maintain luminosity for very long, this could produce a noticeable"
" flickering."

msgid ""
"To minimize this, a TV does not represent frames as a computer does "
"('progressive' mode), but rather represents half-frames, or *fields* at a"
" double refresh rate, hence 50 half frames per second on PAL and 60 half "
"frames per second on NTSC. This was originally bound to the frequency of "
"power lines in Europe (50Hz) and the US (60Hz)."

"In particular, fields are \"interlaced\" in the sense that one field "
"presents all the even lines of the complete frame and the subsequent "
"field the odd ones."

"Since there is a non-negligible time difference between each field (1/50 "
"or 1/60 of a second) merely rendering a frame the usual way and splitting"
" it into two half frames does not work. A noticeable jitter of the edges "
"of moving objects would be present."

"Enable field rendering. When the *Fields* button in the *Render* Panel is"
" pressed (*Post Processing* section), Blender prepares each frame in two "
"passes. On the first it renders only the even lines, then it advances in "
"time by half a time step and renders all the odd lines. This produces odd"
" results on a PC screen (Field Rendering result). but will show correctly"
" on a TV set."

"If you are really confused, a simple trick to determine the correct field"
" order is to render a short test animation of a white square moving from "
"left to right on a black background. Prepare one version with odd field "
"order and another with even field order, and look at them on a television"
" screen. The one with the right field order will look smooth and the "
"other one horrible. Doing this simple test will save you *hours* of "
"wasted rendering time..."

msgid ""
"Nodes are currently not field-aware. This is partly due to the fact that "
"in fields, too much information is missing to do good neighborhood "
"operations (blur, vector blur, etc.). The solution is to render your "
"animation at double the frame rate without fields and do the interlacing "
"of the footage afterwards."
