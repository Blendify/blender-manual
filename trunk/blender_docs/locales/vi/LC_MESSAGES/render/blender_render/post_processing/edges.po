"perfect since real comics and manga also usually have china ink outlines."

"The threshold of the angle between faces for drawing edges, from 0 to "

"background, whereas higher settings start to add outlines on surface "
"edges, starting with sharper angles. At maximum intensity, edge will even"
" faintly display geometry subdivided edge lines in areas of imperfect "
"smoothing."

"It is possible to separate out the edge layer using a render layer "
"dedicated to that purpose. The alpha channel is 0 where there is no edge,"
" and 1 where the edge is. By separating out the edge layer, you can blur "
"it, change its color, mask it, etc. The image above shows how to do this."
" In this example, an Edge render layer is created that only has the Sky "
"and Edge layers The other render layer omits the Edge layer, so it "
"returns just the normal image. On the output panel *Edge* is enabled with"
" a width of 10 in black. Then that layer goes through a blur node. Using "
"the Alpha Over node, then the cube is composited on top of the blurred "
"edge. The result gives a soft-shadow kind of effect. Note that "
"Premultiply is set, because the Edge image already has an alpha of 1.0 "
"set."
