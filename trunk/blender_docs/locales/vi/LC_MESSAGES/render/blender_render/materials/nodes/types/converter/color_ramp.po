"A powerful but often overlooked feature of the Color Ramp is to create an"
" Alpha Mask, or a mask that is overlaid on top of another image, and, "
"like a mask, allows some of the background to show through. The example "
"map below shows how to use the Color Ramp node to do this:"

"In the map above, a black-and-white swirl image, which is lacking an "
"alpha channel, is fed into the Color Ramp node as a *Factor*. "
"(Technically, we should have converted the image to a value using the RGB"
" to BW node, but hey, this works just as well since we are using a BW "
"image as input)."

"We have set the Color Ramp node to a purely transparent color on the left"
" end of the spectrum, and a fully Red color on the right. As seen in the "
"viewer, the Color Ramp node puts out a mask that is fully transparent "
"where the image is black. Black is zero, so Color Ramp uses the color at "
"the left end of the spectrum, which we have set to transparent. The Color"
" Ramp image is fully red and opaque where the image is white (1.00)."

"In this example, we have mapped the shades of gray in the input image to "
"three colors, blue, yellow, and red, all fully opaque (Alpha of 1.00). "
"Where the image is black, Color Ramp substitutes blue, the currently "
"selected color. Where it is some shade of gray, Color Ramp chooses a "
"corresponding color from the spectrum (bluish, yellow, to reddish). Where"
" the image is fully white, Color Ramp chooses red."
