"Mirror reflections are computed in the Blender Render and Cycles "
"Renderers using ray tracing. (n.b. Reflections are not available in the "
"Game Engine). Ray tracing can be used to make a material reflect its "
"surroundings, like a mirror. The principle of ray-traced reflections is "
"very simple: a ray is fired from the camera and travels through the scene"
" until it encounters an object. If the first object hit by the ray is not"
" reflective, then the ray takes the color of the object. If the object is"
" reflective, then the ray bounces from its current location and travels "
"up to another object, and so on, until a non-reflective object is finally"
" met and gives the whole chain of rays its color."

#: ../../manual/render/blender_render/materials/properties/mirror.rst:17
msgid ""
"Eventually, the first reflective object inherits the colors of its "
"environment, proportional to its *Reflectivity* value. Obviously, if "
"there are only reflective objects in the scene, then the render could "
"last forever. This is why a mechanism for limiting the travel of a single"
" ray is set through the *Depth* value: this parameter sets the maximum "
"number of bounces allowed for a single ray."

"You need to enable ray tracing in your scene settings if you want to use "

"The *Mirror Color* in the mirror panel is the color of the light "
"reflected back. Usually, for normal mirrors, use white. However, some "
"mirrors color the reflection (e.g. metals), so you can change the color "
"by clicking on the color button. The amount of mirrored reflection is "
"determined by the *Reflectivity* value. If set to something greater than "
"0, mirrored reflectivity will be activated and the reflection will be "
"tinted the color set in Mirror Color."

"Color of mirrored reflection By default, an almost perfectly reflective "

"copper and gold, for example. In order to replicate this within Blender, "
"you have to set the Mirror Color accordingly. To set a mirror color, "
"simply click the color button in the mirror panel and select a color."
