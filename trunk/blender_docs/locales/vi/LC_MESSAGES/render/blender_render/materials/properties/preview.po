"The Preview panel gives a quick visualization of the active material "
"applied on to one of several basic objects. Including its *Shaders*, "
"*Ramps*, *Mirror*, *Transparency* properties and *Textures*. It provides "
"several shapes that are very useful for designing new shaders: For some "
"shaders (like those based on *Ramp* colors, or a Diffuse shader like "
"*Minnaert*), one needs fairly complex or specific previewing shapes to "
"decide if the shader being designed achieves its goal."
