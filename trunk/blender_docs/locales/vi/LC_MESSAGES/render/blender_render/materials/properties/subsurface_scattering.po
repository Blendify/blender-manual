"Simulates semi-translucent objects in which light rays enter, bounce "
"around, then exit in a different place. Many organic and inorganic "
"materials are not totally opaque right at the surface, so light does not "
"just bounce off the top surface. Instead, some light also penetrates the "
"skin surface deeply, and scatters around inside, taking on the color of "
"the insides and emerging back out at a different location. Human/animal "
"skin, the skin of grapes, tomatoes, fruits, wax, gels (like honey, or "
"Jello) and so on all have subsurface scattering (SSS), and photo-realism "
"really cannot be achieved without it."

"At first the irradiance, or brightness, of the surface is calculated, "

"pretty much the same as in a normal render. Ambient Occlusion, Radiosity,"

"In the second step, the final image is rendered, but now the SSS shader "
"replaces the diffuse shader. Instead of the lamps, the calculated "
"lightmap is used. The brightness of a surface point is the calculated "
"\"Average\" of the brightness of its surrounding points. Depending on "
"your settings the whole surface may be taken into account, and it is a "
"bit more complicated than simply calculating the average, but do not "
"bother too much with the math behind it."

"Because of the way this scattering is calculated, when using large radius"

"an unfortunate limitation. A way to lessen this effect is use multiple "

"This is not in fact the radius of the subsurface scattering, but the "
"average path length between scattering events. As the light travels "
"through the object it bounces around then emerges from the surface at "
"some other point. This value corresponds to the average length the light "
"travels between each bounce. The longer the path length is, the further "
"the light is allowed to scatter. This is the main source of a material's "
"perceived \"scatter color.\" A material like skin will have a higher red "
"radius than green and blue. Subsurface scattering is the diffusion of "
"light beneath the surface. You control how far the light spreads to "
"achieve a specific result."
