"\"A watched pot never boils\" is the old saying, but you may wonder why "
"your render takes so long to create, or worse, crashes mid-way through! "
"Well, there is lots going on and lots you can do to speed up rendering or"
" enable a complicated render to complete. Also, it is possible to render "
"a very complicated scene on a mediocre PC by being \"render-smart\". Here"
" is a \"top ten\" list of things to do or not do in order to speed up "
"rendering or even avoid crashes during scene render. Some options may "
"decrease the quality of your render, but for draft renders you may not "
"care."

"Switch to an Orthographic camera, and render your own \"parts\" of the "
"scene as separate images, and then paste those parts together in GIMP. An"
" old trick in making your own panorama with a real camera is to take "
"three or so pictures of a very wide (beach sunset) scene, where you take "
"one picture, rotate to the right, snap another, then another, and when "
"you get the pictures developed, you overlap them to make a very wide "
"landscape image. Do the same in Blender: render out one shot to a file, "
"then move the camera to look at a different area of the scene, and render"
" that shot. Each shot will be of a smaller area and thus take in fewer "
"polygons/faces. Be sure that when you position your camera that you snap "
"overlapping shots, so that you can then match them up. If you do not want"
" to use GIMP, you can use compositing nodes and the Translate node to "
"match them up in Blender."

"Another strategy that can be used to address the problem of long "

"into components that can be rendered separately, then you combine those "

"If the camera is not moving, then neither is the background: only a "

"Start by using lights that do not cast shadows (shadow calculations are "

"but do not cast light) to create shadows *only* where you judge that they"
" are actually necessary (it is very often the case that only a few of the"

"This is a very familiar idea. Modern sound recordings, for example, "
"always use a \"multi-track\" approach. Individual components of the song "
"are captured separately and in isolation, then the components are "
"\"mixed\" together. The \"final mix\" then goes through additional "
"processing stages, called *mastering*, to produce the finished product(s)"

"In practice, the deadline-killer is *re*-rendering, which ordinarily must"

"Sometimes you might find that it is *almost* what you wanted, but now you"

"Of course, this approach is not without its own set of trade-offs. You "
"must devise a workable asset management system for keeping track of "
"exactly what material you have, where it is, whether it is up-to-date, "

"\"library linking\" features of Blender to allow you to refer to objects,"
" nodes, materials, textures and scenes in a carefully-organized "
"collection of other files. You need to have a very clear notion, *in "
