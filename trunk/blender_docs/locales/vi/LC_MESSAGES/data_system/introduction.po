"Blender has the ability to encapsulate (incorporate) various kinds of "
"data within the blend-file that is normally saved outside of the blend-"
"file. For example, an image texture that is an external image file can be"
" put \"inside\" the blend-file via *Pack Into blend-file*. When the "
"blend-file is saved, a copy of that image file is put inside the blend-"
"file. The blend-file can then be copied or emailed anywhere, and the "
"image texture moves with it."
