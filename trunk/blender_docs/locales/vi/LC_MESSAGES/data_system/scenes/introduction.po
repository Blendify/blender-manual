"This option creates a new scene with the same settings and contents as "

"contains links to the objects in the old scene. Therefore, changes to "
"objects in the new scene will result in the same changes to the original "

"This means that you can change the position, orientation and size of the "
"objects in the new scene without affecting other scenes, but any "
"modifications to the object-data (meshes, materials, etc.) will also "
"affect other scenes. This is because a single instance of the \"object-"
"data\" is now being shared by all of the objects in all of the scenes, "
