Translations

.. note::

   At time of writing we are setting up translations workflow,
   this page shows the initial steps for translators to get started.


Installing Dependencies
=======================

For translations we use Sphinx's internationalization package.
However this is not included with Sphinx and needs to be installed.

.. code-block:: sh

   pip install sphinx-intl


Downloading the Repository
==========================

First of all, its assumed that you have the manual already building.

From the directory containing your checkout of the manual run the following command.

.. code-block:: sh

   svn checkout https://svn.blender.org/svnroot/bf-manual-translations/trunk/blender_docs/locale locale

This will create a ``locale/`` subdirectory.

Now you can edit the PO translation files,
eg: ``locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES/getting_started/about_blender/introduction.po``

These files can be edited and committed back to svn.


Building with Translations
==========================

.. note::

   This is quite involved, and it may not be expected that translators have to build the translated manual locally.

   Instead we may rely on the docs being build automatically online.

----

To creates the ``.mo`` files (needed for building translation).

.. code-block:: sh

   sphinx-intl build

Now you can build the manual with the translation applied.

.. code-block:: sh

   make -e SPHINXOPTS="-D language='fr'"

If you're on ms-windows and don't have ``make``, run:

.. code-block:: sh

   sphinx-build -b html -D language='fr' ./manual ./build/html

Now you will have a build of the manual with translations applied.


Updating PO Files
-----------------

As the original manual changes, the templates will need updating.

This can be done as follows.

.. code-block:: sh

   make gettext
   sphinx-intl update -p build/locale -l fr

The updated templates can then be committed to svn.

*TODO: document how to handle files being added/removed/moved.*
