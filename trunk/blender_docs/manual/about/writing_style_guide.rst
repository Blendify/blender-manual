Writing Style Guide
*******************

Rules of thumb:

- American English (eg: modeling and not modelling, color and not colour).
- *Spell checking is strongly recommended.*
- Use of correct grammar, appropriate wording and simple English.
- Sentences should be kept short and clear, resulting in text that is easy to read, objective and to the point.
- Do not write in first person perspective, about yourself or your own opinions.
- Avoid `weasel words <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word>`__ and being unnecessarily vague, eg:

  | *"Reloading the file will probably fix the problem"*
  | *"Most people don't use this option because ..."*
- Avoid *Product Placement* - unnecessarily promoting software or hardware brands.
  Keep content vendor-neutral where possible.
- Avoid technical explanations about the mathematical/algorithmic implementation of a feature
  if there is a simpler way to explain it (e.g. explaining how mesh smoothing algorithms work is unnecessary,
  but the blending types of a mix node do need a mathematical explanation).
- Avoid repetition of large potions of text - simply explain it once, and from then on refer to that explanation.

  In some cases you might also consider defining a ``:term:`` in the **glossary**.
- Avoid enumerating similar options, such as listing every preset or every frame-rate in a drop-down.

  Their contents may be summarized or simply omitted.

  *Such lists are only showing what is already obvious in the interface
  and end up being a lot of text to read & maintain.*
- Avoid documenting changes in Blender between releases, thats what the release notes are for.
  We only need to document the current state of Blender.
- Unless the unit a value is measured in is obscure and unpredictable, there is no need to mention it.
- Do not simply copy the tool-tips from Blender.

  *People will come to the manual to learn more than is provided by the UI.*
- Including why or how an option might be useful is a good idea.
- If you are unsure about how a feature works, ask someone else or find out who developed it and ask them.
