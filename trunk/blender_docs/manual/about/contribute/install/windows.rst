Installation Guide for Editing the Blender Manual on MS-Windows
***************************************************************

This guide covers the following topics:

#. `Installing Python`_ (used to "convert" the source files to HTML)
#. `Installing SVN and Downloading the Repository`_
#. `Setting up the Build Environment`_


Installing Python
=================

#. Download the Python installation package for MS-Windows from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

      (In this guide version 3.5.x is used).

#. Install Python with the installation wizard.

      (In this guide the default settings are used).


Installing SVN and Downloading the Repository
=============================================

In this guide, we will use TortoiseSVN though any Subversion client will do.

#. Download TortoiseSVN for MS-Windows from `here <https://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html>`__
#. Install TortoiseSVN with the installation wizard. When choosing which features will be installed,
   it is recommended that you enable *command line client tools* to give you access to SVN from the command line
   (there is no harm in doing this, and it may be helpful if you ever run into any trouble).
#. Once the installation has finished, create a new folder that will contain everything related to the Blender Manual.
   In this guide, we will use ``C:\blender_docs``.
#. Open the new folder, right click and choose *SVN Checkout...* from the context menu.
#. In the *URL of repository* field, enter: ``https://svn.blender.org/svnroot/bf-manual/trunk/blender_docs``.
#. In the *Checkout directory* field, enter: ``C:\blender_docs``.
#. Click *OK* - the repository will now be downloaded
   which may take a few minutes depending on your internet connection.


Setting up the Build Environment
================================

- Open a command prompt and change to the repository folder using

   .. code-block:: sh

      cd C:\blender_docs

- Install the all the dependencies using Python's ``pip`` command

   .. code-block:: sh

      pip install -r requirements.txt

- If all goes well, you should see the following message when it is finished

   .. code-block:: sh

      Successfully installed Jinja2 MarkupSafe Pygments Sphinx docutils sphinx-rtd-theme Cleaning up...

During the setup, some warnings may be shown, but do not worry about them.
However, if any errors occur, they may cause some problems.

.. note::

   Every now and then you may want to make sure your dependencies are up to date using:

   .. code-block:: sh

      pip install -r requirements.txt  --upgrade
