Whether you like to fix a tiny spelling mistake or rewrite an entire chapter,
your help with the Blender manual is most welcome!


How It Works
============

In a nutshell:

- The manual is written in the `reStructuredText <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html>`__ markup language.
- The manual sources are hosted in a central repository (at blender.org).

- You download the source files from the repository and edit them using a plain text editor.
- You convert (build) the modified source files into HTML web pages on your local disk to see how your changes 
  later look like on `blender.org/manual <https://blender.org/manual/>`__.
- When you are satisfied with your work, commit your modified files to the central repository
  for others to work with and continue collaborating.
- Soon after your changes are committed to the central repository,
  the modifications become visible in the online blender manual.
