How It Works
============

You can modify the manual by editing local text files, 
these files are kept in sync with those online via a repository, 
based on this the server will update the online manual. 

The manual is written in the `reStructuredText <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html>`__ (RST) markup language
and can be edit using a plain text editor.
For a local preview, you convert (build) the manual source files from RST into HTML web pages.
