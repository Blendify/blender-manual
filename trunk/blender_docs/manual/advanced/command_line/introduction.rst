Introduction
************

The *Console Window*, also called a *Terminal*, is an operating system text window that displays
messages about Blender's operations, status, and internal errors.

Use Cases:

- For automation and batch processing which require launching Blender
  with different :doc:`arguments </advanced/command_line/arguments>`.
- For Python development, to see the output of the ``print()`` command.
- If Blender exits unexpectedly, the messages may indicate the cause or error.
- When troubleshooting, to see the output of ``--debug`` messages.


Platform Dependent Instructions
===============================

Linux
-----

The Blender *Console Window* in Linux will typically only be visible on the desktop
if Blender is manually started from a terminal. Blender outputs to the
*Console Window* it is started from.

Depending on your desktop environment setup, a Blender icon may appear on your desktop or an
entry for Blender is added to your menu after you install Blender. Often you can edit such an icon
and enable "Run in terminal".

Apple macOS
-----------

macOS uses "files" with the ``.app`` extension called *applications*.
These files are actually folders that appear as files in Finder.
In order to run Blender you will have to specify that path to the Blender executable inside this folder,
to get all output printed to the terminal.
You can start a terminal from :menuselection:`Applications --> Utilities`.
The path to the executable in the ``.app`` folder is ``./blender.app/Contents/MacOS/blender``.

If you have Blender installed in the Applications folder, the following command can be used:

.. parsed-literal:: /Applications/blender-\ |BLENDER_VERSION|/blender.app/Contents/MacOS/blender

Microsoft Windows
-----------------

When Blender is started on a Microsoft Windows operating system, the *Console Window*
(called the Command Prompt) is first created as a separate window on the desktop.
The main Blender window will also appear and the *Console Window* will then be toggled off.
To display the console again, go to :menuselection:`Window --> Toggle System Console`.

To start Blender from the command line you need to open an instance of Command Prompt.
To do this, type :kbd:`WinKey-R` then type :kbd:`cmd`; this will open the Command Prompt window.
You then need to find the path to the Blender executable. If you installed Blender via the installer
then it can be found here:

.. parsed-literal:: C:\\Program Files\\Blender Foundation\\Blender\\blender.exe

The screenshot shows the Blender *Console Window* on Microsoft Windows directly after starting
Blender and then a short while later after opening a file along with the relevant messages.

.. tip:: Closing the Blender Console Window

   Closing the *Console Window* will also close Blender, losing any unsaved work.

   To turn off the console without closing Blender,
   just run *Toggle System Console* again from the menu (as mentioned above).


Console Window Status and Error Messages
========================================

The *Blender Console Window* can display many different types of Status and Error Messages.
Some messages simply inform the user what Blender is doing, but have no real impact on Blender's ability to function.
Other messages can indicate serious errors that will most likely prevent Blender carrying out a particular task and
may even make Blender non-responsive or shut down completely. The *Blender Console Window* messages can
also originate internally from within the Blender code or from external sources such as
:doc:`Python scripts </preferences/addons>`.


Common Messages
---------------

- ``found bundled python: (FOLDER)``

  This message indicates that Blender was able to find the :ref:`Python <scripting-index>`
  library for the Python interpreter embedded within Blender.
  If this folder is missing or unable to be found,
  it is likely that an error will occur, and this message will not appear.

- ``malloc returns nil()``

  When Blender carries out operations that require extra memory (RAM), it calls a function called malloc
  (short for memory allocate) which tries to allocate a requested amount of memory for Blender.
  If this cannot be satisfied, malloc will return nil/null/0 to indicate that it failed to carry out the request.
  If this happens Blender will not be able to carry out the operation requested by the user.
  This will most likely result in Blender operating very slowly or shutting down.
  If you want to avoid running out of memory you can install more memory in your system,
  reduce the amount of detail in your Blender models,
  or shut down other programs and services which may be taking up memory that Blender could use.
