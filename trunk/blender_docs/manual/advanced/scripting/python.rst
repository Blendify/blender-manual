Introduction
============

Python is an interpreted, interactive,
object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing,
very high level dynamic data types, and classes.
Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax.

Python scripts are a powerful and versatile way to extend Blender functionality.
Most areas of Blender can be scripted, including Animation, Rendering, Import and Export,
Object Creation and the scripting of repetitive tasks.

To interact with Blender, scripts can make use of the tightly integrated API
(Application Programming Interface).
