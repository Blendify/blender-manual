Introduction
************

Python is an interpreted, interactive,
object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing,
very high-level dynamic data types, and classes.
Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax.

Python scripts are a powerful and versatile way to extend Blender functionality.
Most areas of Blender can be scripted, including Animation, Rendering, Import and Export,
Object Creation and the scripting of repetitive tasks.

To interact with Blender, scripts can make use of the tightly integrated API
(Application Programming Interface).

Extending Blender
=================

Add-ons
-------

Add-ons are scripts you can enable to gain extra functionality within Blender,
they can be enabled from the User Preferences.

Outside of the Blender executable,
there are literally hundreds of add-ons written by many people:

- Officially supported add-ons are bundled with Blender.
- Other **Testing** add-ons are included in development builds but not official releases.
  Many of them work reliably and are very useful but are not ensured to be stable for release.

For an overview of all add-ons available see the
`Scripts Catalog <https://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:2.6/Py/Scripts>`__.


Scripts
-------

Apart from add-ons, there are also scripts you can use to extend Blender's functionality:

- Modules: Utility libraries for import into other scripts.
- Presets: Settings for Blender's tools and key configurations.
- Startup: These files are imported when starting Blender.
  They define most of Blender's UI, as well as some additional core operators.
- Custom scripts: In contrast to add-ons they are typically intended for one-time execution via the
  :doc:`Text Editor </editors/text_editor>`


Saving your own scripts
-----------------------

File location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All scripts are loaded from the ``scripts`` folder of the
:doc:`local, system and user paths </getting_started/installing/configuration/directories>`.

You can setup an additional search path for scripts in
:ref:`prefs-file-paths` :menuselection:`User Preferences --> File Paths`.


Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Add-ons are conveniently installed through Blender in the :doc:`User Preferences </preferences/addons>`.
Click the :menuselection:`Install from File...` button and select the ``.py`` or ``.zip`` file.

To manually install scripts or add-ons place them in the ``add-ons``,
``modules``, ``presets`` or ``startup`` directory according to their type.
See the description above.

You can also run scripts by loading them in the :doc:`Text Editor </editors/text_editor>`.
