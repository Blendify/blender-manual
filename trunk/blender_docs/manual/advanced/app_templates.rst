Application Templates
*********************

Usage
=====

Application templates are a feature that allows you to define a re-usable configuration
that can be selected to replace the default configuration,
without requiring a separate Blender installation or overwriting your personal settings.


.. figure:: /images/advanced-app_template-file_menu.png
   :align: right
   :scale: 50 %

   Using templates from the file menu.

.. figure:: /images/advanced-app_template-splash.png
   :scale: 33 %

   Selecting a template from the splash screen.


Application templates can be selected from the splash screen or the file menu *(as shown above)*.


When there are no templates found the menu will not be displayed on the splash screen.

New application-templates can be installed from the file menu.


Motivation
----------

In some cases its not enough to write a single script or add-on,
and expect someone to replace their user-preferences and startup file, install scripts and change their key-map.

The goal of application-templates is to support switching to a customized configuration
without disrupting your existing settings & installation.

This means people can build their own *applications* on top of Blender that can be easily distributed.


Details
-------

An application-template may defines its own:

Startup File
   The default file to load with this template.
User Preferences
   Only certain user-preferences from a template are used:

   - Themes.
   - Add-ons.
   - Keymaps.
   - Viewport lighting.
Splash Screen
   Templates may provide their own splash screen image.
Python Scripts
   While templates have access to the same functionality as any other scripts,
   typical operations include:

   - Modifying and replacing parts of the user-interface.
   - Defining new menus, key-maps & tools.
   - Defining a custom add-on path for template specific add-ons.


Templates also have their own user configuration so saving startup while using a template
wont overwrite your default startup file.


Directory Layout
----------------

Templates may be located in one of two locations within the ``scripts`` directory.

Template locations:
   | ``{BLENDER_USER_SCRIPTS}/startup/bl_app_templates_user``
   | ``{BLENDER_SYSTEM_SCRIPTS}/startup/bl_app_templates_system``


User configuration is stored in a sub directory,

Without a template:
   | ``./config/startup.blend`` 
   | ``./config/userpref.blend`` 
With a template:
   | ``./config/{APP_TEMPLATE_ID}/startup.blend`` 
   | ``./config/{APP_TEMPLATE_ID}/userpref.blend`` 

See :ref:`getting-started_installing-config-directories` for details on script and configuration locations.


Template Contents
=================

Each of the following files can be used for application templates but are optional.

``startup.blend``
   Factory startup file to use for this template.
``userpref.blend``
   Factory user-preferences file to use for this template.

   *(As noted previously, this is only used for a subset of preferences).*
``splash.png``, ``splash_2x.png``
   Splash screen do override Blender's default artwork (not including header text).

   Must be ``501x230`` or ``1002x460`` (used for HiDPI monitors).
``__init__.py``
   A Python script which mush contain ``register`` and ``unregister`` functions.

.. note::

   Bundled blend files ``startup.blend`` and ``userpref.blend`` are considered *Factory Settings*
   and are never overwritten.

   The user may save their own startup/preferences while using this template which will override them.

   The original template settings can be loaded using: *Load Template Factory Settings*
   from the file menu in much the same way *Load Factory Settings* works.
