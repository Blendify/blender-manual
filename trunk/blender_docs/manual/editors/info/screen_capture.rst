   Save Screenshot option.

:kbd:`Ctrl-F3` will take a screenshot of Blender and then open the :doc:`File Browser </editors/file_browser/index>`,
allowing you to specify the name and location of the screenshot.
In the example image at the right, the ``PNG`` format will be the output of the screenshot taken
(settings are the same as the ones available to save render results).
When the :doc:`File Browser </editors/file_browser/index>` opens, on the left, there is a tab
called *Save Screenshot* where you can find format settings and a checkbox with the option
*Full Screen*.

- Check the Option to save the entire Blender window
  (full width and height of the Blender window you are using when you call the command).
- Uncheck the box to save only your active area (where your mouse is located when you call the command).
