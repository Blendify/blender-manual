Strip Input
***********

Controls the source of the strip. Fields include file path, file name, image offset,
crop settings.

This is here you can editupdate the path of the file used by a strip. Very useful when you
moved it one way or the other - this avoid you deleting and re-creating the strip!

You have two text fields for path, the first being the path of the parent directory
(Path), and the second the file name itself.
