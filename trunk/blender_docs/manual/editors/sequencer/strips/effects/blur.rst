Gaussian Blur
*************

The Gaussian Blur strip is used to blur the input strip in a defined direction.
This can be used to blur a background or to blur a transition strip.
For example, in the image below it shows an example of this strip being used to blur a transition.
In this set up the *Gaussian Blur Strip* is modifying a
:doc:`Adjustment Layer Strip </editors/sequencer/strips/effects/adjustment>`
where the curve defines the amount of blur over the length of the *Adjustment Layer Strip*.
