This effect works by itself to create a color strip. By default, when it is created,
it is 50 frames long, but you can extend it by grabbing and moving one of the ends.
Click on the color swatch in the Effect panel under Sequencer buttons,
which is under the Scene tab, to pick a different color (by default, it is gray).
Use this strip crossed with your main movie to provide a fade-in or fade-out.
