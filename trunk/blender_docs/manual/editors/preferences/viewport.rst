   Blender Preferences Viewport section.


Display
=======

Object Info
   Display the active Object name and frame number at the bottom left of the 3D View.
View Name
   Display the name and type of the current view in the top left corner of the 3D View.
   For example: "User Perspective" or "Top Orthographic".
Playback FPS
   Show the frames per second screen refresh rate while an animation is played back.
   It appears in the viewport corner, displaying red if the frame rate set cannot be reached.

.. _prefs-viewport-gizmo-size:

Gizmo Size
   Diameter of the gizmo.
Look Dev Sphere Size
   Diameter of the LookDev sphere overlay.
3D Viewport Axis
   Interactive Navigation
      Display the axis as an interactive gizmo.

      :Click: Sets the viewport to display along this axis.
      :Drag: Orbit the view.
   Simple Axis
      Display simple, less intrusive axis in the viewport.

      :Size: Size of the simple axis.
      :Brightness: How vivid the colors of the simple axis are.
   Off
      Disables the viewport axis.


.. _prefs-system-multisampling:

Quality
=======

.. TODO2.8: document what the difference exactly is between anti-aliasing & multisampling is.

Viewport Anti-aliasing
   Control the :term:`anti-aliasing` for higher quality rendering.
Multisampling
   This enables :term:`multisampling` for higher quality rendering, at the expense of some performance.
Grease Pencil Multisampling
   Control the :term:`anti-aliasing` for higher quality Grease Pencil rendering.
Edit-Mode Smooth Wires
   Display smooth wire in Edit Mode, without this wire will be rendered aliased.

   Some users prefer to disable this for increased visibility,
   since edges don't blend into other shaded regions.


Textures
========

Limit Size
   Limit the maximum resolution for pictures used in textured display to save memory.
   The limit options are specified in a square of pixels
   (e.g: the option 256 means a texture of 256Ã—256 pixels). This is useful for game engineers,
   whereas the texture limit matches paging blocks of the textures in the target graphic card memory.
Anisotropic Filtering
   Sets the level of anisotropic filtering.
   This improves the quality of textures that are rendered at the cost of performance.
Clip Alpha
   Clip alpha below this threshold in the 3D View.
   Note that, the default is set to a low value to prevent issues on some GPU's.
Image Display Method
   Method to render images; the following options are supported:

   Automatic
      Automatically use *GLSL* which runs on the GPU for performance but falls back to
      the CPU for large images which might be slow when loaded with the GPU.
   2D Texture
      Uses CPU for display transform and render images as a 2D texture.
   GLSL
      Fastest method using GLSL for display transform and render images as a 2D texture.


Selection
=========

OpenGL Depth Picking
   This option uses an alternative method of picking which uses depth information to select the front-most elements.
   It is only used for selecting with the cursor (not box select, lasso, circle select, etc.).

   Performance varies depending on your OpenGL hardware and drivers.
