Studio Lights
=============

*Studio Lights* are used to illuminate 3D viewport during *Solid View* and will not be rendered.

Unlike lights in the scene, the lighting direction follows the viewport orientation.

Editor
------

There are up to four virtual light sources.

The Light icons allow the user to enable or disable individual lights.
At least one of the four lights must remain enabled for the 3D View.
The lights are equal, except for their direction and color.
You can control the direction of the lights, as well as their diffuse and specular colors.

   Diffuse
      This is the constant color of the light.
   Specular
      This is the highlight color of the light.
