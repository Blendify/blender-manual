Grease Pencil
*************

This Mode allows you adjust the timing of the :doc:`Grease Pencil objects's </grease_pencil/index>`
animation frames. It is especially useful for animators blocking out shots,
where the ability to re-time blocking is one of the main purposes of the whole exercise.

This mode can be accessed by changing the Dope Sheet editor's *Mode* selector (found in the header to the far left)
to *Grease Pencil*.

To use this editor mode, make sure you have a :doc:`Grease Pencil object </grease_pencil/index>` selected.

Channels Region
===============

Grease Pencil (light blue)
   The channels' region shows the Grease Pencil data-blocks containing the layers.
   Multiple blocks are used for each area (e.g. one for the 3D View and the Image editor).
Layers (gray)
   These channels contain the keyframes to which
   the :doc:`layers </grease_pencil/properties/layers>` are bound.


Header
======

Active Only
   Only show the Grease Pencil data-blocks attached to the current scene and the objects within it.


Insert Keyframe
---------------

Insert Keyframe :kbd:`I` can be used for creating blank Grease Pencil frames at a particular frame.
It will create blank frames if *Additive Drawing* is disabled, otherwise
it will make a copy of the active frame on that layer, and use that.


Copying Frames
--------------

It is possible to copy frames from one layer to another,
or from object to object, using the *Copy* and *Paste* tools in the *Key* menu.
Note that keyframes will be pasted into selected layers, so make sure you have a destination layer selected.


Main View
=========

The keyframes can be manipulated like any other data in the *Dope Sheet*.
Interpolated keyframes (alias breakdowns) are visualized as smaller light blue points.
