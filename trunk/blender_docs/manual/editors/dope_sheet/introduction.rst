   The Dope Sheet.


Classical hand-drawn animators often made a chart, showing exactly when each drawing,
sound and camera move would occur, and for how long. They nicknamed this the "dope sheet".
While CG foundations dramatically differ from classical hand-drawn animation,
Blender's *Dope Sheet* inherits a similar directive.
It gives the animator a "birds-eye-view" of every thing occurring within a scene.


Dope Sheet Modes
================

   Dope Sheet Modes.


There are four basic views for the Dope Sheet. These all view different contexts of animation:

Dope Sheet
   The Dope Sheet Mode allow you to edit multiple actions at once.
Action Editor
   :doc:`Action Editor </editors/dope_sheet/action>` is where you can define and control actions.
Shape Key Editor
   :doc:`ShapeKey Editor </editors/dope_sheet/shapekey>` is dedicated to the *Shapekey* data-blocks.
Grease Pencil
   :doc:`Grease Pencil </editors/dope_sheet/grease_pencil>` is dedicated to
   the :doc:`grease pencil tool's </interface/grease_pencil/index>`
   keyframes for each :doc:`grease pencil layer </interface/grease_pencil/drawing/layers>`,
   you have a strip along which you can grab its keys,
   and hence easily re-time your animated sketches.

   .. note::

      Note that you will have as much top-level grease pencil channels as you have sketched areas
      (3D Views, *UV/Image Editor*, etc.)


Interface
=========

The *Dope Sheet Editor* interface is somewhat similar to the *Graph Editor*
one, it is divided in three regions:

   The Action Editor with object channels.


Header

Here you find the menus, a first block of controls related to the editor "mode",
a second one concerning the action data-blocks, and a few other tools
(like the copy/paste buttons, and snapping type).

Marker Menu
^^^^^^^^^^^

See the :doc:`Markers page </animation/markers>`.


Main Region
-----------

It contains the keyframes for all visible action channels.
As with the other "time" editor, the X-axis represents time.
The Y-axis has no mean in itself, unlike with the *Graph Editor*, it is a "stack" of action channels.

Each one being shown as an horizontal colored strip (of a darker shade "during" the animated/keyed period).
On these channel strips lay the keyframes, visualized as light-gray (unselected) or yellow (selected) diamonds.

One of the key feature of this editor is that it allow you to visualize immediately which channel (i.e. F-Curve)
is *really* affected. When the value of a given channel does not change at all between two neighboring keyframes
("long keyframes"), a gray (unselected) or yellow (selected) bar is drawn between them.
Similar bars are drawn between keyframes tagged as moving hold.


Channels Region
---------------

   The action editor showing sliders.

See :doc:`/editors/graph_editor/channels`.


Editing
^^^^^^^

On channels you can have another column with value-sliders,
allowing you to change the value of current keyframes, or to add new ones.
See `View Menu`_ above for how to show these sliders.
