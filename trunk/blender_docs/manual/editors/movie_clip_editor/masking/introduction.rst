Masks have many purposes. They can be used in a motion tracking workflow to mask out,
or influence a particular object in the footage.
They can be used for manual rotoscoping to pull a particular object out of the footage,
or as a rough matte for green screen keying. Masks are independent from a particular image of movie clip,
and so they can just as well be used for creating motion graphics or other effects in the compositor.
These masks can also be used in other places in Blender.
