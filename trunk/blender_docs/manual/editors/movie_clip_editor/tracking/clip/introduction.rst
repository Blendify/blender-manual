The Clip View is used is the main part of the of the Movie Clip editor.
Almost all motion tracking tools are concentrated in the Movie Clip Editor.

It should be mentioned that the camera solver consists of three quite separate steps:

#. Solving camera, scene orientation, and scene reconstruction.
