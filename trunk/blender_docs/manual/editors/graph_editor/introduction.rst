Introduction
************

The Graph editor is the main animation editor.
It allows you to modify the animation for any properties using
:doc:`F-Curves </editors/graph_editor/fcurves/introduction>`.

The graph editor has two modes, *F-Curve* for :doc:`Actions </animation/actions>`,
and *Drivers* for :doc:`Drivers </animation/drivers/index>`. Both are very similar in function.

   The Graph Editor.


Curve View
==========

Here you can see and edit the curves and keyframes.

.. figure:: /images/editors_graph-editor_introduction_graph_curve.png

   A curve with different types of interpolation.


See :doc:`F-Curves </editors/graph_editor/fcurves/introduction>` for more info.


Navigation
----------

As with most editors, you can:

Pan
   Pan the view vertically (values) or horizontally (time) with click and drag (:kbd:`MMB`).
Zoom
   Zoom in and out with the mouse wheel (:kbd:`Wheel`).
Scale View
   Scale the view vertically or horizontally (:kbd:`Ctrl-MMB`).

These are some other useful tools.

View All
   Reset viewable area to show all keyframes (:kbd:`Home`).
View Selected
   Reset viewable area to show selected keyframes (:kbd:`NumpadPeriod`).


2D Cursor
---------

.. figure:: /images/editors_graph-editor_introduction_2dcursor.png

   Graph Editor 2D Cursor.


The current frame is represented by a green vertical line called the *Time Cursor*.

As in the :doc:`Timeline </editors/timeline>`,
you can change the current frame by pressing or holding :kbd:`LMB`.

The green horizontal line is called the *Cursor*.
This can be disabled via the *View Menu* or the *View Properties* panel.

The *Time Cursor* and the *Cursor* make the *2D Cursor*.
The *2D Cursor* is mostly used for editing tools.


View Axes
---------

For *Actions* the X-axis represents time,
the Y-axis represents the value to set the property.

For *Drivers* the X-axis represents the *Driver Value*,
the Y-axis represents the value to set the property.

Depending on the selected curves, the values have different meaning:
For example rotation properties are shown in degrees,
location properties are shown in Blender Units.
Note that *Drivers* use radians for rotation properties.


Markers
-------

Like with most animation editors, markers are shown at the bottom of the editor.

.. figure:: /images/editors_graph-editor_introduction_markers.png

   Graph Editor Markers.


*Markers* can be modified in the *Graph Editor* though it's usually best to use the *Timeline*.

See :doc:`Markers </animation/markers>` for more info.


Header
======

View Menu
---------

.. _graph-preview-range:

Preview Range
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Set Preview Range :kbd:`P`
   Interactively define frame range used for playback.
   Allow you to define a temporary preview range to use for the :kbd:`Alt-A` realtime playback
   (this is the same thing as the *Playback Range* option of the
   :ref:`Tmeline editor header <animation-editors-timeline-headercontrols>`).
Clear Preview Range :kbd:`Alt-P`
   Clears the preview range.
Auto-Set Preview Range :kbd:`Ctrl-Alt-P`
   Automatically sets the preview range to playback the whole action or
   the selected NLA strips.


Mode
----

F-Curve for :doc:`Actions </animation/actions>`,
and Drivers for :doc:`Drivers </animation/drivers/index>`.

   Graph Mode.


View Controls
-------------

.. figure:: /images/editors_graph-editor_introduction_header_view.png

   View Controls.

Show Only Selected (mouse cursor icon)
   Only include curves related to the selected objects and data.
Show Hidden (ghost icon)
   Include curves from objects/bones that are not visible.
Show Only Errors (livesaver icon)
   Only include curves and drivers that are disabled or have errors.
   Useful for debugging.
Search Filter (magnifying glass icon) :kbd:`F`
   Only include curves with keywords contained in the search field.

   Multi-Word (az icon)
      Fuzzy/Multi-Word name filtering matches word snippets/partial words,
      instead of having to match everything. It breaks down the search string based on whitespace placement.
      e.g. "lo ro" will filter all location and rotation, while "lc rt" will *not* work.
Type Filter
   Filter curves by property type.

   Data-block Sort (az icon)
      Objects data-blocks appear in alphabetical order, so that it is easier to find where they occur
      (as well as helping to keep the animation of related objects together in the NLA for instance).

      If you find that your playback speed suffers from this being enabled
      (it should only really be an issue when working with lots of objects in the scene),
      you can turn this off.

Normalize
   Normalize curves so the maximum or minimum point equals 1.0 or -1.0.

   Auto
      Automatically recalculate curve normalization on every curve edit.
      This is useful to prevent curves from jumping after tweaking it.


Curve Controls
--------------
