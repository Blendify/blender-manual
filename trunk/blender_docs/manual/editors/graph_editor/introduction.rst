Introduction
************

The graph editor is the main animation editor.
It allows you to modify the animation for any properties using
:doc:`F-Curves </editors/graph_editor/fcurves/introduction>`.

The graph editor has two modes, *F-Curve* for :doc:`Actions </animation/actions>`,
and *Drivers* for :doc:`Drivers </animation/drivers>`. Both are very similar in function.

   The Graph Editor.


Curve Editor Area
=================

Here you can see and edit the curves and keyframes.

.. figure:: /images/graph_curve.jpg

   A curve with different types of interpolation.


See :doc:`F-Curves </editors/graph_editor/fcurves/introduction>` for more info.


Navigation
----------

As with most editors, you can:

Pan
   Pan the view vertically (values) or horizontally (time) with click and drag (:kbd:`MMB`).

Zoom
   Zoom in and out with the mouse wheel (:kbd:`Wheel`).

Scale View
   Scale the view vertically or horizontally (:kbd:`Ctrl-MMB`).

These are some other useful tools.

View All
   Reset viewable area to show all keyframes (:kbd:`Home`).

View Selected
   Reset viewable area to show selected keyframes (:kbd:`NumpadPeriod`).


2D Cursor
---------

.. figure:: /images/graph_2dcursor.jpg

   Graph Editor 2D Cursor.


The current frame is represented by a green vertical line called the *Time Cursor*.

As in the :doc:`Timeline </editors/timeline>`,
you can change the current frame by pressing or holding :kbd:`LMB`.

The green horizontal line is called the *Cursor*.
This can be disabled via the *View Menu* or the *View Properties* panel.

The *Time Cursor* and the *Cursor* make the *2D Cursor*.
The *2D Cursor* mostly used for editing tools.


View Axes
---------

For *Actions* the X-axis represents time,
the Y-axis represents the value to set the property.

For *Drivers* the X-axis represents the *Driver Value*,
the Y-axis represents the value to set the property.

Depending on the selected curves, the values have different meaning:
For example rotation properties are shown in degrees,
location properties are shown in Blender Units.
Note that *Drivers* use radians for rotation properties.


Markers
-------

Like with most animation editors, markers are shown at the bottom of the editor.

.. figure:: /images/graph_markers.jpg

   Graph Editor Markers.


*Markers* can be modified in the *Graph Editor* though its usually best to use the *Timeline*.

See :doc:`Markers </animation/markers>` for more info.
