Editing
*******

By default, when new channels are added, the *Graph Editor* sets them to *Edit Mode*.
Selected channels can be locked by pressing :kbd:`Tab`.

Many of the hotkeys are the same as the viewport ones, for example:

- :kbd:`G` to grab
- :kbd:`R` to rotate
- :kbd:`S` to scale
- :kbd:`B` for border select/deselect

And of course you can lock the transformation along the X (time frame) or Y
(value) axises by pressing :kbd:`X` or :kbd:`Y` during transformation.

For precise control of the keyframe position and value,
you can set values in the *Active Keyframe* of the Properties Region.


Insert Keyframe
===============

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB`, :kbd:`Ctrl-Shift-LMB`

:kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` inserts a keyframe to the active F-Curve at the mouse position.
The newly added keyframes will be selected, making it easier to quickly tweak the newly added keyframes.
All previously selected keyframes are kept selected by using :kbd:`Ctrl-Shift-LMB`.


Transform Snapping
==================

When transforming keyframes with :kbd:`G`, :kbd:`R`, :kbd:`S`,
the transformation can be snapped to increments.

Snap Transformation to 1.0 :kbd:`Ctrl`.

Divide Transformation by 10.0 :kbd:`Shift`.


Snap
----

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Key --> Snap`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`Shift-S`

Keyframes can be snapped to different properties by using the *Snap Keys* tool.

Current Frame
   Snap the selected keyframes to the *Time Cursor*.
Cursor Value
   Snap the selected keyframes to the *Cursor*.
Nearest Frame
   Snap the selected keyframes to their nearest frame individually.
Nearest Second
   Snap the selected keyframes to their nearest second individually, based on the *FPS* of the scene.
Nearest Marker
   Snap the selected keyframes to their nearest marker individually.
Flatten Handles
   Flatten the *BÃ©zier* handles for the selected keyframes.

Mirror
======

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Key --> Mirror`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`Shift-M`

Selected keyframes can be mirrored over different properties using the *Mirror Keys*
tool.

By Times Over Current Frame
   Mirror horizontally over the *Time Cursor*.
By Values over Cursor Value
   Mirror vertically over the *Cursor*.
By Times over Time 0
   Mirror horizontally over frame 0.
By Values over Value 0
   Mirror vertically over value 0.
By Times over First Selected Marker
   Mirror horizontally the over the first selected *Marker*.


Clean Keyframes
===============

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Key --> Clean Keyframes`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`X`

*Clean Keyframes* resets the keyframe tangents on selected keyframes to their auto-clamped shape,
if they have been modified.

.. list-table::

   * - .. figure:: /images/editors_graph-editor_fcurves_introduction_clean1.png
          :width: 320px

          F-Curve before cleaning.

     - .. figure:: /images/editors_graph-editor_fcurves_introduction_clean2.png
          :width: 320px

          F-Curve after cleaning.


Clean Channels
===============

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Key --> Channels`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`X`

Acts like the *Clean Keyframes* tool but will also delete the channel itself if it is only left with
a single keyframe containing the default property value and
it's not being used by any generative f-curve modifiers or drivers.

.. note::

   The modified curve left after the clean tool is run is not the same as the original,
   so this tool is better used before doing custom editing of f-curves and after initial keyframe insertion,
   to get rid of any unwanted keyframes inserted while doing mass keyframe insertion
   (by selecting all bones and pressing :kbd:`I` for instance).


Smoothing
=========

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Key --> Smooth Keys`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`Alt-O`

There is also an option to smooth the selected curves , but beware: its algorithm seems to be
to divide by two the distance between each keyframe and the average linear value of the curve,
without any setting, which gives quite a strong smoothing! Note that the first and last keys
seem to be never modified by this tool.

.. list-table::

   * - .. figure:: /images/editors_graph-editor_fcurves_introduction_clean1.png
          :width: 320px

          F-Curve before smoothing.

     - .. figure:: /images/editors_graph-editor_fcurves_editing_smooth.png
          :width: 320px

          F-Curve after smoothing.


Sampling and Baking Keyframes
=============================

Sample Keyframes :kbd:`Shift-O`
   Sampling a set a keyframes replaces interpolated values with a new keyframe for each frame.

   .. list-table::

      * - .. figure:: /images/editors_graph-editor_fcurves_editing_sample.png
             :width: 320px

             F-Curve before sampling.

        - .. figure:: /images/editors_graph-editor_fcurves_editing_sample2.png
             :width: 320px

             F-Curve after sampling.


Bake Curves :kbd:`Alt-C`
   Baking a curve replaces it with a set of sampled points, and removes the ability to edit the curve.


Bake Sound to F-Curves
======================

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Key --> Bake Sound to F-Curves`

The *Bake Sound to F-Curves* tool takes and sound file and uses its sound wave to create the animation data.

Lowest frequency
   Cutoff frequency of a high-pass filter that is applied to the audio data.
Highest frequency
   Cutoff frequency of a low-pass filter that is applied to the audio data.
Attack time
   Value for the hull curve calculation that tells how fast the hull curve can rise.
   The lower the value the steeper it can rise.
Release time
   Value for the hull curve calculation that tells how fast the hull curve can fall.
   The lower the value the steeper it can fall.
Threshold
   Minimum amplitude value needed to influence the hull curve.

Accumulate
   Only the positive differences of the hull curve amplitudes are summarized to produce the output.
Additive
   The amplitudes of the hull curve are summarized. If *Accumulate* is enabled,
   both positive and negative differences are accumulated.
Square
   Gives the output as a square curve.
   Negative values always result in -1, and positive ones in 1.

   Square Threshold
      All values lower than this threshold result in 0.


Show/Hide
=========

Hide :kbd:`H`
   Hide selected curves.
Hide Unselected :kbd:`Shift-H`
   Show only the selected curve (and hide everything else).
Show Hidden :kbd:`Alt-H`
   Show all previous hidden curves.
