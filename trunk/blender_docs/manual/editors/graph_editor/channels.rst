Channels Region
===============

.. figure:: /images/editors_graph-editor_introduction_channels-region.png

   The Channels Region.

The channels region is used to select and manage the curves for the Graph editor.
This part shows the objects and their animation data hierarchy each as headers.
Each level can be expended/collapsed by the small arrow to the left of its header.

- Scenes, Objects (dark blue)
- :doc:`Actions </animation/actions>`, :doc:`Shape keys </animation/shape_keys/index>`, etc. (light blue)
- Groups (green)
- Channels (gray)


Controls
--------

On the headers, there are toggles to control channel's setting:

Pin (pin icon)
   ToDo (Graph editor only).
Hide (eye icon)
   Hides the channel(s)/curve (Graph editor only).
Modifiers (wrench icon)
   Deactivates the F-Modifiers of the curve or all curves in the channel.
Mute (speaker icon)
   Deactivates the channel/curve.
Lock (padlock icon)
   Toggle channel/curve from being editable.

   .. note::

      In the Dope Sheet this is also working inside the NLA,
      but that it does not prevent edition of the underlying F-Curve).

^^^^^^^

.. figure:: /images/editors_dopesheet_action-editor-sliders.png

   The Action editor showing sliders.

On channels headers you can have another column with number buttons or sliders,
allowing you to change the value on the current keyframes, or to add new keyframes.
See :ref:`graph-view-menu` for how to show these sliders.


Menu
=====

Delete Channels :kbd:`X`
   Deletes the whole channel from the current action
   (i.e. unlink the underlying F-Curve data-block from this action data-block).

   .. warning::

      The :kbd:`X` shortcut is area-dependent: if you use it in the left list part,
      it will delete the selected channels, whereas if you use it in the main area,
      it will delete the selected keyframes.

Un/Group Channels :kbd:`Ctrl-G`, :kbd:`Alt-G`
   ToDo.
Settings Toogle/Enable/Disable, :kbd:`Shift-W`, :kbd:`Ctrl-Shift-W`, :kbd:`Alt-W`

   Expands or collapses selected channels.

   This allows you to move top-level channels up/down :kbd:`Shift-PageUp`, :kbd:`Shift-PageDown`,
   or directly to the top/bottom :kbd:`Ctrl-Shift-PageUp`, :kbd:`Ctrl-Shift-PageDown`.
