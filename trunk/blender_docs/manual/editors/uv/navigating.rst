Navigating
**********

The UV Editor has a 2D cursor. Its position can be changed by :kbd:`LMB`
clicking in the UV editor. You can also manually adjust its position in the Sidebar region.
The range by default is from 0 to 256 starting from the lower left corner.
By enabling :ref:`Pixel Coordinates <bpy.types.SpaceUVEditor.show_pixel_coords>`, the range changes from 0 to 1.

2D View
=======

Panning can be done by clicking the :kbd:`MMB` and dragging.

Zooming can be done by scrolling :kbd:`Wheel` up or down.
Also, as in the 3D View, you can use :kbd:`NumpadPlus` or :kbd:`NumpadMinus` to zoom.
