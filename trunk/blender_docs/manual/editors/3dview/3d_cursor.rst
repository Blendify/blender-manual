3D Cursor
*********

The 3D Cursor is simply a point in 3D space which can be used for a number of purposes.


Placement
=========

There are a few methods to position the 3D cursor.


Direct Placement with the Mouse
-------------------------------

.. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_3d-cursor_two-view-positioning.png
   :align: center

   Positioning the 3D cursor with two orthogonal views.


Using :kbd:`LMB` in the 3D View will place the 3D cursor directly under your mouse pointer.

For accuracy you should use two perpendicular orthogonal 3D Views, i.e.
any combination of top :kbd:`Numpad7`, front :kbd:`Numpad1` and side :kbd:`Numpad3`.
That way you can control the positioning along two axes in one view and determine depth in the second view.

To place the 3D Cursor on the surface of geometry,
enable *Cursor Depth* in the :doc:`User Preferences </preferences/interface>`.

.. seealso::

   The :doc:`Snap Menu </editors/3dview/object/editing/transform/control/precision/snap>`
   which allows the cursor placement relative to scene objects.


3D Cursor panel
---------------

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     All Modes
   | Panel:    :menuselection:`Properties region --> 3D Cursor`

.. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_3d-cursor_panel.png

   The 3D Cursor panel of the Properties region.


The 3D cursor can also be positioned by editing the location coordinates values in
the *3D cursor* panel of the *Properties* region.


Usage
=====

Todo.
