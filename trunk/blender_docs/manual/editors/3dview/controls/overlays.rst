Viewport Overlays
*****************

Using the Viewport Overlays pop-over settings for the overlays can be configured.
There is a switch to turn off all overlays for the 3D View.

The options that are visible in the pop-over depends on the mode that the 3D View is in.


Object Mode
===========

The next options are always present, independent the current mode.


Guides
------

Grid
   Show grid in orthographic side view.
Floor
   Show the ground plane.

   X/Y/Z
      Show the X and/or Y and/or Z axis line.

Scale
   The distance between lines in the grid/floor.
Subdivision
   The number of subdivisions between grid lines.

Text Info
   Show text overlay.
3D Cursor
   Show the 3D Cursor overlay.
Annotations
   Show the annotation overlay.


Objects
-------

Extra
   Show details of objects including empty wires, cameras and other visual guides.
Relationship Lines
   Show dashed lines indicating parents or constraint relationships.
Outline Selected
   Show an outline highlight around selected objects.
Bones
   Show Bones. Disable to only show their motion path.
Motion Paths
   Show the motion path overlay.
Origin
   Show the object origin of the active object.
Origin (All)
   Show the object origin of all objects.


Geometry
--------

Wireframe
   Show the face edges overlay.

   Wireframe
      Adjust the number of wires to display. 1.0 means show all wires.

Face Orientation
   Show the face orientation overlay. In the face orientation overlay
   all faces where the face normal point towards the camera are colored blue.
   All faces where the face normal point away from the camera are colored red.
   With this overlay it is easy to detect the orientation of the face normals.


Motion Tracking
---------------

Show the motion tracking overlay.

Camera Path
   Show the reconstruction camera path.
Marker Names
   Show the names for reconstructed track objects.

Tracks
   Change the display of the reconstructed tracks.

   - Plain Axes
   - Arrows
   - Single Arrow
   - Circle
   - Cube
   - Sphere
   - Cone

Size
   Change the display size of the recontructed tracks.


Mesh Edit Mode

   Highlight the selected edges.
Faces
   Highlight selected faces.
Center
   Display face center.
Creases
   Display the creases created for subdivision surface modifier.
Sharp
   Display sharp edges, used with the edge split modifier.
Bevel
   Display weights created for the bevel modifier.
Seams
   Display the UV unwrapping seams.


Shading
-------

Hidden Wire
   Use hidden wire display.
Vertex Groups Weights
   Display weights in Edit Mode.

   Zero Weights
      Display unweighted vertices:

      - None

   Overhang
      Minimum/Maximum
         Minimum/Maximum angle to display.
      Axis
         Axis and direction to use as the bases to calculate the angle to visualize.
   Thickness
      Minimum/Maximum
         Minimum/Maximum thickness to display.
      Samples
         Number of samples to use to calculate the thickness.
   Intersect
      At what places does the mesh intersect with itself.
   Distortion
      Minimum/Maximum
         Minimum/Maximum distortion to display.
   Sharp
      Minimum/Maximum
         Minimum/Maximum angle to display.


Measurement
-----------

Edge Length
  Display the length of selected edges as part of the text info overlay.
Edge Angle
  Display the angle of selected edges as part of the text info overlay.
Face Area
  Display the area of selected faces as part of the text info overlay.
Face Angles
  Display the angles of the corners of selected faces in the text info overlay.


Normals
-------

- Display vertex normals
- Display face normals at vertices
- Display face normals

Size
  The size to draw the selected normals.


Developer
---------

Indices
   Display the indices of selected vertices, edges and faces.


Freestyle
---------

Edge Marks
   Display Freestyle edge marks, used with the Freestyle renderer.
Face Marks
   Display Freestyle face marks, used with the Freestyle renderer.
