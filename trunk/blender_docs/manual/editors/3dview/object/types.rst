Object Types
************

New objects can be created with the *Add* menu in the 3D Views header.

Mesh
   :doc:`Meshes </modeling/meshes/introduction>` are objects composed of Polygonal Faces, Edges and/or Vertices,
   and can be edited extensively with Blender's mesh editing tools.
   See :doc:`Mesh Primitives</modeling/meshes/primitives>`.
Curve
   :doc:`Curves </modeling/curves/introduction>` are mathematically defined objects
   which can be manipulated with control handles or control points (instead of vertices),
   to manage their length and curvature. See :doc:`Curves Primitives </modeling/curves/primitives>`.
Surface
   :doc:`Surfaces </modeling/surfaces/introduction>` are patches that are also manipulated with control points.
   These are useful for simple rounded forms and organic landscapes.
   See :doc:`Surfaces Primitives</modeling/surfaces/primitives>`.
Metaball
   :doc:`Meta Objects </modeling/metas/introduction>` (or Metaballs) are objects formed by a mathematical function
   (with no control points or vertices)  defining the 3D volume in which the object exists.
   Meta Objects have a liquid-like quality, where when two or more Metaballs are brought together,
   they merge by smoothly rounding out the connection, appearing as one unified object.
   See :doc:`Meta Primitives </modeling/metas/primitives>`.
Text
   :doc:`Text objects</modeling/texts/introduction>`
   create a two dimensional representation of a string of characters.
Armature
   :doc:`Armatures </rigging/armatures/index>` are used for :doc:`rigging </rigging/introduction>`
   3D models in order to make them poseable and animateable.
Lattice
   :doc:`Lattices </rigging/lattice>` are non-renderable wireframes, commonly used for taking additional control
   over other objects with help of the :doc:`Lattice Modifier </modeling/modifiers/deform/lattice>`.
Empty
   :doc:`Empties </modeling/empties>` are null objects that are simple visual transform nodes that do not render.
   They are useful for controlling the position or movement of other objects.
Speaker
   :doc:`Speaker </render/audio/speaker>` brings to scene source of sound.
Camera
   This is the virtual camera that is used to determine what appears in the render.
   See Cameras in :doc:`Blender Internal </render/blender_render/camera/index>`,
   :doc:`Cycles </render/cycles/camera>`.
Lamp
   These are used to place light sources in the scene. 
   See Lamps in :doc:`Blender Internal </render/blender_render/lighting/lamps/index>`,
   :doc:`Cycles </render/cycles/lamps>`.
Force Field
   :doc:`Force Fields </physics/force_fields/index>` are used in physical simulations.
   They give simulations external forces, creating movement,
   and are represented in the 3D View editor as small control objects.
Group Instance
   See :doc:`/editors/3dview/object/properties/duplication/dupligroup`.
