Object Origin
*************

Each object has an origin point. The location of this point determines where the object is located in 3D space.
When an object is selected, a small circle appears, denoting the origin point.
The location of the origin point is important when translating, rotating or scaling an object.
See :doc:`Pivot Points </editors/3dview/object/transform/transform_control/pivot_point/index>` for more.

The color of the origin is set by the :doc:`/animation/state_colors` and
the size can be changed in the :doc:`Interface tab </preferences/interface>` of the User Preferences.

   the center of the object.
