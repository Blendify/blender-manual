Transformations refer to a number of operations that can be performed on a
selected Object or Mesh that alters its position or characteristics.

Each object can be moved, rotated and scaled in *Object Mode*.
However, not all of these transformations have an effect on all objects.
For example, scaling a camera has no effect on the render dimensions.

:doc:`Basic transformations </editors/3dview/object/transform/basic_transform>` include:

- Grabbing (moving)
- Rotating
- Scaling

These three transforms are the three big ones however, more, advanced transformations can be found in the
:doc:`Advanced Transformations </editors/3dview/object/transform/index>` section.

For making other changes to the geometry of editable objects,
you should use *Edit Mode*.

Once you have added a basic object, you remain in *Object Mode*.

You can switch between *Object Mode* and *Edit Mode* by pressing :kbd:`Tab`.

The object's wireframe should now appear orange. This means that the object is now selected and active.

The Fig. Selected object image shows both the solid view and wireframe view of the default cube.
To switch between wireframe and solid view, press :kbd:`Z`.
