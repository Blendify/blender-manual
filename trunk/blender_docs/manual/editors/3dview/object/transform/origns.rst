Object Origins
**************

Each object has an origin point. The location of this point determines where the object is located in 3D space.
When an object is selected, a small circle appears, denoting the origin point.
The location of the origin point is important when translating, rotating or scaling an object.
See :doc:`Pivot Points </editors/3dview/object/transform/transform_control/pivot_point/index>` for more.


Moving Object Centers
=====================

Object Centers can be moved to different positions through
:menuselection:`3D View editor --> Transform --> Origin` (press :kbd:`T` to open panel):

Geometry to Origin
   Move model to origin and this way origin of the object will also be at the center of the object.
Origin to Geometry
   Move origin to the center of the object and this way origin of the object will also be at
   the center of the object.
Origin to 3D Cursor
   Move origin of the model to the place of the 3D cursor.
Origin to Center of Mass
   Move origin to calculated center of mass of model.
