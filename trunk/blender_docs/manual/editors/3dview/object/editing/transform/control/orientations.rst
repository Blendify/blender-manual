Orientations affect the behavior of Transformations: Location, Rotation, and Scale.
You will see an effect on the 3D Manipulator (the widget in the center of the selection),
as well as on transformation constraints
(like :doc:`axis locking </editors/3dview/object/editing/transform/control/precision/axis_locking>`).
This means that, when you press :kbd:`G-X`, it will constrain to the *global* X-axis,
but if you press :kbd:`G-X-X` it will constrain to your *Transform Orientation* s X-axis.

   Transform Orientations selector.


The Orientations options can be set through the *Orientation* selector in a 3D View header,
with :kbd:`Alt-Spacebar`, or in the Transform Orientations panel in the Properties region.

Transform Orientations
   In addition to the four preset options,
   you can define your own custom orientation (see `Custom Orientations`_ below).


Orientations
============

Global
   The manipulator matches the global axis.

   When using the Global orientation, the orientation's XYZ matches world's XYZ axis.
   When this mode is selected,
   the local coordinates of the object are subjected to the Global coordinates.
   This is good to place objects in the scene. To constrain an axis,
   press :kbd:`G` and the desired axis. To constrain to a local axis,
   press the desired axis two times. The difference between Global and Local, is more noticeable
   when you have an object in which the origin is not located at the exact center of the object,
   and does not match the Global coordinates.

Local
   The manipulator matches the object axis.

   Notice that, here, the Manipulator is at a slight tilt
   (it is most visible on the object's Y-axis, the green arrow).
   This is due to our 15° rotation of the object.
   This demonstrates the difference between local coordinates and global coordinates.
   If we had rotated the object 90° along its X-axis, we would see that the object's "Up" is the
   world's "Forward" -- or the object's Z-axis would now be the world's Y-axis.
   This orientation has an effect on many parts of the interface,
   so it is important to understand the distinction.

Normal
   The Z-axis of the manipulator will match the normal vector of the selection.

   In Object Mode, this is equivalent to Local Orientation, in Edit Mode,
   it becomes more interesting.

   As you see, the light blue lines indicate the faces' normals,
   and the darker blue lines indicate the vertex normals (these were turned on in the
   :kbd:`N` Properties region under :menuselection:`Mesh Display --> Normals --> Face` and
   *Vertex*).
   Selecting any given face will cause our Manipulator's Z-axis to align with that normal.
   The same goes for Vertex Select Mode.
   Edge Select is different -- A selected Edge has the Z-axis aligned with it
   (so you will have to look at the Manipulator widget to determine the direction of X and Y).
   If you select several elements, it will orient towards the average of those normals.

   A great example of how this is useful is in Vertex Select Mode: Pick a vertex and then do
   :kbd:`G, Z, Z` to tug it away from the mesh and shove it into the mesh.
   To make this even more useful, select a nearby vertex and press :kbd:`Shift-R` to repeat
   the same movement -- except along that second vertex's normal instead.

Gimbal
   Uses a :term:`Gimbal` behavior that can be changed
   depending on the current :ref:`Rotation Mode <rotation-modes>`.

View
   The manipulator will match the 3D View:

   - Y: Up/Down
   - X: Left/Right
   - Z: Towards/Away from the screen.

   This way you can constrain movement to one View axis with :kbd:`G-X-X`.


Custom Orientations
-------------------

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Object and Edit Modes
   | Panel:    :menuselection:`Properties region --> Transform Orientations`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`Ctrl-Alt-Spacebar`

.. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_object_transform-control_transform-orientations_custom.png

   Custom orientation.


You can define custom transform orientations, using object or mesh elements. Custom transform
orientations defined from objects use the local orientation of the object whereas those
defined from selected mesh elements (vertices, edges, faces)
use the normal orientation of the selection.

The *Transform Orientations* panel, found in the Properties region,
can be used to manage transform orientations: selecting the active orientation,
adding and deleting custom orientations.

.. figure:: /images/orientations-custom-name.png
   :width: 300px

   Renaming a Custom Orientation.


The default name for these orientations comes from whatever you have selected.
If an edge, it will be titled, "Edge," if an object,
it will take that object's name, etc.


Create Orientation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Just after creating the orientation, the Create Orientation Operator panel gives a few options:

Name
   Text field for naming the new orientation.
Use View
   The new orientation will be aligned to the view space.
Use after creation
   If checked it leaves the newly created orientation active.
Overwrite previous
   If the new orientation is given an existing name, a suffix will be added to it to avoid overwriting the old one,
   unless *Overwrite previous* is checked, in which case it will be overwritten.


Workflow
^^^^^^^^

.. figure:: /images/orientations-custom-extrusion.png

   Custom Extrusion.


The technique of creating custom orientations can become important in creating precise meshes.
In Fig. :ref:`fig-view3d-transform-orientation-extrusion`, to achieve this effect:

#. Select the object's sloping top edge
#. Create a Custom Orientation with :kbd:`Ctrl-Alt-Spacebar` and rename it "Top Edge".
#. Select the objects's bottom, right edge.
#. Extrude with :kbd:`E`.
#. Cancel the extrusion's default movement by pressing :kbd:`RMB` or :kbd:`Esc`.
#. Hit :kbd:`G` to reinitiate movement.
#. Hit :kbd:`Z-Z` to constrain to the "Top Edge" orientation.

Align to Transform Orientation
==============================

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Object and Edit Modes
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Object --> Transform --> Align to Transform Orientation`

Aligns (rotates) the selected objects so that their local orientation matches the active transform orientation
in the Transform orientation panel or the *Orientation* selection in the Transform Operator panels.


Examples
========

Demo Cube
---------

.. figure:: /images/orientations-basicsetup.png

   To demonstrate the various behaviors, we add some colors to the default cube,
   rotate it -15° along its local Z- and X Axes, and we scale its "y" face down.


Please note two things:

- The "Mini-axis" in the lower-left corner, which represents the Global X, Y, Z orientation.
- The :doc:`"Object Manipulator" </editors/3dview/object/editing/transform/control/manipulators>`
  widget emanating from the selection, which represents the current Transform Orientation.

  - If you click on one of the axes of the Manipulator with :kbd:`LMB`,
    it will allow you to constrain movement to only this direction.
    An example of a keyboard equivalent is :kbd:`G, Z, Z`.
  - If you :kbd:`Shift-LMB` click,
    it will lock the axis you clicked on and allow you to move in the plane of the two remaining axes.
    The keyboard analogue is :kbd:`G, Shift-Z, Shift-Z`.


Effect on Manipulators
----------------------

The image below shows a cube with the rotation manipulator active in multiple transform orientations.
Notice how the manipulator changes depending on the orientation selected (compare A with F).

Similarly, notice how when normal orientation (F and G)
is selected the manipulator changes between *Object Mode* and *Edit Mode*.
The normal orientation manipulator will also change depending on what is selected in
*Edit Mode* i.e. the orientation is based on the normal of the selection which will
change depending on how many and which faces, edges or vertices are selected.
