.. _bpy.ops.object.*clear:

Clear
=====

Clearing transforms simply resets the transform values.
The objects location and rotation values return to 0, and the scale returns to 1.

   | Mode:     Object Mode
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Object --> Clear --> Clear Location/Clear Scale/Clear Rotation/Clear Origin`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`Alt-G`, :kbd:`Alt-S`, :kbd:`Alt-R`, :kbd:`Alt-O`


Options

.. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_transform-control_object-transformations-clear-transformations.png

   Clear Transformation menu.

Clear Location :kbd:`Alt-G`
   Clear (reset) the location of the selection.
   This will move the selection back to the coordinates (0, 0, 0).
Clear Scale :kbd:`Alt-S`
   Clear (reset) the scale of the selection.
   This will resize the selection back to the size it was when created.
Clear Rotation :kbd:`Alt-R`
   Clear (reset) the rotation of the selection.
   This will set the rotation of the selection to 0 degrees in each plane.
Clear Origin :kbd:`Alt-O`
   Clears (resets) the offset of the child objects origin.
   This will cause child objects to move to the origin of the parent.


Apply
=====

These operations lets you apply several transformations to the selected objects.
The object transformation coordinates are transferred to the object data.
If the objects have hierarchical descendants, it also applies those transformations to their children.


.. _bpy.ops.object.transform_apply:

Apply Object Transformations
----------------------------

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Object Mode
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Object --> Apply -->`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`Ctrl-A`


Applying transform values essentially resets the values of object's position, rotation,
or scale, but does not actually do anything to the object.
The object origin point is moved to the global origin and the transform values are set to zero.
In terms of scale, the scale values return to 1.

To apply a transform select the *Apply* sub-menu from the *Object menu* or
use the shortcut :kbd:`Ctrl-A` and select the appropriate transform to apply.
The Operator panel lets you choose the combination of transformations to apply.

.. warning:: Armature Objects

   While applying transformation to armatures is supported,
   this does **not** apply to their pose position, animation curves or constraints.

   This tool should be used before rigging and animation.


Options
^^^^^^^

.. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_transform-control_object-transformations-apply-transformations.png

   Apply Transformation menu.

Location
   Apply (set) the location of the selection.
   This will make Blender consider the current location to be equivalent to 0 in each plane
   i.e. the selection will not move, the current location will be considered to be the "default location".
   The Object origin will be set to actual (0, 0, 0) (where the colored axis lines intersect in each view).
Rotation
   Apply (set) the rotation of the selection.
   This will make Blender consider the current rotation to be equivalent to 0 degrees in each plane
   i.e. the selection will not rotated, the current rotation will be considered to be the "default rotation".
Scale
   Apply (set) the scale of the selection.
   This will make Blender consider the current scale to be equivalent to 0 in each plane
   i.e. the selection will not scaled, the current scale will be considered to be the "default scale".
Rotation and Scale
   Apply (set) the rotation and scale of the selection. Do the above two applications simultaneously.
Apply Properties *(access from the toolbar)*
   When disabled, some elements aren't modified:

   - Curve vertex radius.
   - Metaball radius.
   - Armature bone radius and envelope size.

Transforms to Deltas
--------------------

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Object Mode
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Object --> Apply -->`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`Alt-Shift-G`, :kbd:`Alt-Shift-R`, and :kbd:`Alt-Shift-S`

Clear both the normal and :ref:`Delta transforms <transform-delta>`.

- Location to Deltas :kbd:`Alt-Shift-G`
- Rotation to Deltas :kbd:`Alt-Shift-R`
- Scale to Deltas :kbd:`Alt-Shift-S`

All Transforms to Deltas
   Converts all "normal" transformations to delta transforms.
Reset Values
   ToDo.
Animated Transform to Deltas
   Converts the "normal" transformation animations (animations done to the translation, scale,
   and, rotation values) to Delta transforms. To use this tool simply select the object with the
   animations that you want to convert press :kbd:`Ctrl-A` and select *Animated Transform to Deltas*.


.. _bpy.ops.object.visual_transform_apply:

Visual Transform
----------------

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Object Mode
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Object --> Apply --> Visual Transform`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`Ctrl-A`

Apply (set) the result of a constraint and apply this back to the Object's location, rotation and scale.


Visual Geometry as Mesh
-----------------------

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Object Mode
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Object --> Apply --> Visual Geometry as Mesh`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`Ctrl-A`

Apply the visual state of all selected objects (modifiers, shape keys, hooks... etc) to object data.
This is a way to freeze all object data into static meshes, as well as converts non-mesh types to mesh.


.. _bpy.ops.object.duplicates_make_real:

Make Duplicate Real
-------------------

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Object Mode
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Object --> Apply --> Make Duplicate Real`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`Shift-Ctrl-A`

*Make Duplicates Real* unlinks linked duplicates so each duplicate now has its own data-block.

Parent
   Parents all the generated objects to the former duplicator when the option is checked;
   otherwise, they will be global objects.
Keep Hierarchy
   If this option is checked, the internal hierarchies (i.e. parent relationships)
   will be preserved in the newly generated objects,
   even if *Parent* is also checked, in which case, only the duplicated objects on top of the hierarchy
   will be parented to the former duplicator.
