Point Selection
===============

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     All Modes
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`RMB` and :kbd:`Shift-RMB`

The simplest form of object selection consists of using :kbd:`RMB` on it.
To add to the selection, use :kbd:`Shift-RMB` on more objects.
If the objects are overlapping in the view, you can use :kbd:`Alt-RMB`
to cycle through possible choices (*Object Mode* only).
If you want to add to a selection this way then the shortcut becomes :kbd:`Shift-Alt-RMB`.
To activate an object that is already selected, click :kbd:`Shift-RMB` on it.

To *deselect* an active object,
click :kbd:`Shift-RMB` one time and hence, two clicks if the object is not active.
Note that this only works if there are no other objects under the mouse.
Otherwise it just adds those to the selection. There appears to be no workaround for this bug.


.. _bpy.ops.view3d.select_border:

Border Select
=============

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Object Mode and Edit Mode
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Select --> Border Select`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`B`

To activate the tool, press :kbd:`B`.
With *Border Select* you draw a rectangle while holding down :kbd:`LMB`.
Any object that lies even partially within this rectangle becomes selected.
If any object that was last active appears in the selection it will become active.

For deselecting objects, use :kbd:`MMB` or *Border Select* again while holding
:kbd:`Shift` or :kbd:`Alt`. To cancel the selection use :kbd:`RMB`.

.. hint::

   *Border Select* adds to the previous selection, so in order to select
   only the contents of the rectangle, deselect all with :kbd:`A` first.


.. _bpy.ops.view3d.select_circle:

Circle Select
=============

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Object Mode and Edit Mode
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Select --> Circle Select`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`C`

*Circle Select* :kbd:`C` is used by moving with dotted circle through objects with :kbd:`LMB`.
You can select any object by touching of circle area.
It is possible to dynamically change the diameter of circle by scrolling :kbd:`Wheel`
or with :kbd:`NumpadPlus` and :kbd:`NumpadMinus` as seen in pictures below.
Deselection is under the same principle -- :kbd:`MMB`.
To cancel the selection use :kbd:`RMB` or key :kbd:`Esc` or :kbd:`Return`.


.. _bpy.ops.view3d.select_lasso:

Lasso Select
============

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Object Mode and Edit Mode
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB`

Lasso select is used by drawing a dotted line around vertices or the origin of the objects,
in *Object Mode*. To use this hold :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` and simply draw around the points you want to select.

Lasso select adds to the previous selection. For deselection, use :kbd:`Shift-Ctrl-LMB`.


.. _bpy.ops.object.select_all:

(De)select All
==============

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     All Modes
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Select --> (De)select All`,
               :menuselection:`Select --> Inverse`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`A`

If anything was selected it is first deselected.
Otherwise it toggles between selecting and deselecting every visible object.

Action
   Select, Deselect, Invert, Toggle

   Inverse :kbd:`Ctrl-I`
      Selects all objects that were not selected, while deselecting all those which were.


.. _bpy.ops.object.select_random:

Random
======

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Object and Edit Modes
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Select --> Random`

Randomly selects unselected objects based on percentage probability on currently active layers.
On selecting the operator a numerical selection box becomes available in the *Tool Shelf*.
It is important to note that the percentage represents the likelihood of an unselected object being
selected and not the percentage amount of objects that will be selected.


.. _bpy.ops.object.select_mirror:

Mirror
======

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     All Modes
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Select --> Mirror`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`Shift-Ctrl-M`

Select the Mirror objects of the selected object,
based on their names, e.g. "sword.L" and "sword.R".


.. _bpy.ops.object.select_by_layer:

Select All by Layer
===================

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Object Mode
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Select --> Select All by Layer`

   :align: right

   All by Layer selection menu.

This option allows the selection of every single object that belongs to a given layer.
Selected objects become visible.

Match
   The match type for selection.
Extend
   Enable to add objects to current selection rather than replacing the current selection.
Layer

.. tip:: Selection of Objects

   Rather than using the :menuselection:`Select All by Layer` option,
   it might be more efficient to make the needed layers visible and use :kbd:`A` on them.
   This method also allows objects to be deselected.
