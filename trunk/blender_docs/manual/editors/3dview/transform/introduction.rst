Transformations refer to a number of operations that can be performed on a selected Object or
Mesh that alters its position or characteristics.

Each object can be moved, rotated and scaled in *Object Mode*.
However, not all of these transformations have an effect on all objects. For example,
scaling a force field will not increase its effect.

Basic transformations include:

- :doc:`Grabbing (moving) </editors/3dview/transform/grab>`
- :doc:`Rotating </editors/3dview/transform/rotate>`
- :doc:`Scaling </editors/3dview/transform/scale>`

More advanced transformations such as mirroring, shearing and warping can be found in the
:doc:`Advanced Transformations </editors/3dview/transform/index>` section.

For making other changes to the geometry of editable objects,
you should use *Edit mode* (see picture).

Once you've added a basic object, you remain in *Object Mode*.

You can switch between *Object Mode* and *Edit Mode* by pressing :kbd:`Tab`.

The object's wireframe should now appear orange.
This means that the object is now selected and active (see picture *Selected object*).

The (*Selected object*) image shows both the solid view and wireframe view of the default cube.
To switch between wireframe and solid view, press :kbd:`Z`.
