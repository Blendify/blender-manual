   Pivot Point modes.


When rotating or scaling an object or group of vertices/edges/faces,
you may want to shift the :term:`pivot point` to make it easier to manipulate an object.
Using this selector, you can change the pivot point to the location of the:

- Active Element
- Median Point (the average center spot of the selected items)
- Individual Origins
- 3D Cursor
- Bounding Box Center

Each of these can be chosen from the drop-down list in the header of any 3D area,
as seen here in Fig. Pivot Point modes.
The pages linked below describe each *Pivot Point* mode in more detail.
