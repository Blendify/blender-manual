   Pivot Point modes.


The pivot point is the point in space around which all rotations,
scalings and mirror transformations are centered. You can choose one of five *Pivot Points*
from a drop-down list in the header of any 3D area, as seen here in Fig. Pivot Point modes.
The pages linked below describe each *Pivot Point* mode in more detail.
