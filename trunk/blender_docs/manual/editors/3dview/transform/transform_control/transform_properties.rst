********************
Transform Properties
********************

Each object stores its position, orientation, and scale values.
These may need to be manipulated numerically, reset, or applied.


Transform Properties Panel
==========================

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Edit and Object modes
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Object --> Transform Properties`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`N`


The *Transform Properties* section in the *View Properties* panel allows you to view and
manually/numerically control the position, rotation, and other properties of an object, in *Object* mode.
In *Edit* mode, it mainly allows you to enter precise coordinates for a vertex,
or median position for a group of vertices (including an edge/face). As each type of object has a different set of
options in its *Transform Properties* panel in *Edit* mode,
see their respective descriptions in the :doc:`Modeling chapter </modeling/index>`.


Options in Object mode
----------------------

   Transform Properties panel in Object mode.


Location
   The object's center location in global coordinates.
Rotation
   The object's orientation, relative to the global axes and its own center.
Scale
   The object's scale, relative to its center, in local coordinates
   (i.e. the *Scale X* value represents the scale along the local X-axis).
   Each object (cube, sphere, etc.), when created, has a scale of one blender unit in each local direction.
   To make the object bigger or smaller, you scale it in the desired dimension.
Dimensions
   The object's basic dimensions (in blender units) from one outside edge to another, as if measured with a ruler.
   For multi-faceted surfaces, these fields give the dimensions of the bounding box
   (aligned with the local axes - think of a cardboard box just big enough to hold the object).

.. Comment: <!-- ;{{Literal|Link Scale}}
   :If this toggle-button is activated the relation (proportion) between the X, Y and Z values in the
   {{Literal|Scale}} and the {{Literal|Dim}} fields is always preserved.
   Changing one value will change all the others as well with the same multiplication-factor. --> .

Use this panel to either edit or display the object's transform properties such as position,
rotation and/or scaling. These fields change the object's center and then affects the aspect
of all of its *vertices* and faces.


Transform Properties Locking
----------------------------

The locking feature of the Location, Rotation and Scale fields allows you to control a
transform property solely from the properties panel.
Once a lock has been activated any other methods used for transformation are blocked.
For example, if you locked the *Location X* field then you can't use the mouse to
translate the object along the global X axis.
However, you can still translate it using the *Location X* edit field.
Consider the locking feature as a rigid constraint only changeable from the panel.

To lock a field, click the padlock icon next to the field.
The field is unlocked if the icon appears as (|unlock-button|),
and it is locked if the icon appears as (|lock-button|).
