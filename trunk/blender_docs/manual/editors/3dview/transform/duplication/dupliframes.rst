DupliFrames
***********

DupliFrames is a tool to duplicate objects at frames distributed along a path.
This is a useful tool to quickly arrange objects.


Examples
========

.. figure:: /images/Modeling-Dupliframes-example01.jpg
   :width: 300px

   Settings for the curve


:kbd:`Shift-A` to add a *Bezier Circle* and scale it up.
In the *Curve* menu under *Path Animation* enable *Follow*
and set *Frames* to something more reasonable than 100 (say 16).

   Settings for the object


Add a *Monkey*. In the *Object* menu under *Duplication* enable
*Frames* and disable *Speed*.


.. note:: Speed

   The *Speed* option is used when the parent-child relationship is set to *Follow Path* (see below).
   In this example, the monkey will then travel along the circle over 16 frames.

   Parenting


To parent the monkey to the Bezier circle, first select the monkey then the curve
(so that the curve is the active object) and :kbd:`Ctrl-P`.
Select the monkey and :kbd:`Alt-O` to reset its origin.

   Orientation tweaks


You can now change the orientation of the monkey by either rotating it
(either in *Edit mode* or *Object mode*)
or by changing the *Tracking Axes* under *Animation Hacks*
(with the monkey selected). The arrangement of monkeys can, of course,
be further enhanced by editing the curve.


To transform all monkeys into real objects,
first :kbd:`Ctrl-Shift-A` to *Make Duplicates Real*.
All monkeys are now real objects, but still linked copies. To change this,
:menuselection:`Object --> Make Single User --> Object&Data`` then choose *All*.


.. note::

   There are many alternatives to Dupliframes. Which tool to use depends on context.

   - To use a small curve as a profile and a larger curve as a path,
     simply use the former as a *Bevel Object* to the latter.
   - To arrange objects along a curve, combining an *Array Modifier* and a *Curve Modifier* is often useful.
   - Dupliverts can be used to arrange objects, for example, along a circle or across a subdivided plane.
