.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Object Mode
   :Hotkey:    :kbd:`LMB`

Clicking on an object selects it,
using modifier keys you can perform other operations.

Extend/Toggle :kbd:`Shift`
   To add to the selection or de-select when the object is already active.

   This can also be used to activate an object that is already selected.
Center Point :kbd:`Ctrl`
   Selects the object by its center point rather than its contents.
Menu :kbd:`Alt`
   If the objects are overlapping in the view, a menu of objects under the cursor
   can be used, so you can pick the object by it's name.

These can be combined so you can for example - toggle the selection from an objects center point.

.. note::

   Right-click select (see :ref:`keymap-blender_default-prefs-select_with` option) has the advantage that
   selection is possible without having to switch to the select tool.
