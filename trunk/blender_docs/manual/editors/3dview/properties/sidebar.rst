View Panel
==========

The *View* panel lets you set other settings regarding the 3D View.
You can show it with the :menuselection:`View --> View Properties...` menu entry.

Focal Length
   Control the focal length of the 3D View camera in millimeters,
   unlike a :doc:`rendering camera </render/cameras>`.

.. _3dview-view-clip:

Clip Start/End
   Adjust the minimum and maximum distances range to limit the visible range to the area
   between two planes that are orthogonal to the viewing direction of the viewport camera.
   Objects outside the range will not be shown.

   .. note::

      The definition of the two planes depends on the kind of view:

      - Perspective view: The planes with distance of start and end from viewport camera.

      - Orthographic view: The planes with distance of negative end and positive end from the focus point,
        in this case the *Start* is ignored.

   .. warning::

      A large clipping range will allow you to see both near and far objects,
      but reduces the depth precision resulting in artifacts.

      See :ref:`Troubleshooting Depth Buffer Glitches <troubleshooting-depth>` for more information.

Use Local Camera
   Use a local camera in this view, rather then the scene's active camera

Local Camera
   Active camera used in this view to override the (global) scene camera.
   The option is available only when *Use Local Camera* toggle enabled.

Render Region
   Use a Render Border when not looking through a camera.
   Using :kbd:`Ctrl-B` to draw a border region will automatically enable this option.

View Lock
   Lock to Object
      Lock to Object lets you define an object in the *Object* Data ID as the center of the view.
      In that case, the view can be rotated around or zoomed towards that central object,
      but not on translation, unless you translate that itself object
      (this option is not available in a camera view).

   Lock to 3D Cursor
      Lock the center of the view to the position of the 3D cursor.
      It is only available when *Lock to Object* is not active.

   .. _3dview-lock-camera-to-view:

   Lock Camera to View
      When in camera view, all changes in the view (pans, rotations, zooms) will affect the active camera,
      which will follow all those changes. The camera frame will be outlined with a red dashed line.

3D Cursor
   Location
      The location of the 3D Cursor
   
   Rotation
      The rotation of the 3D Cursor
   
   Rotation Mode
      The Rotation mode of the 3D Cursor
   
Collections
   This panel shows a list of collections. The visibility of the collection
   can be changed.

Annotations
   See :doc:`Annotations </interface/annotation_tool>` for more
   information about annotations.
