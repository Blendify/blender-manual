Timeline Editor
***************

The *Timeline* editor, identified by a clock icon,
is shown by default at the bottom of the screen.

.. figure:: /images/timeline.png

   The Timeline.

The *Timeline* is not much of an editor, but more of an information and control.

Here you can have an overview of the animation part of your scene.
What is the current time frame, either in frames or in seconds, where are the keyframes of the active object,
the start and end frames of your animation, markers, etc...

The *Timeline* has *Player Controls*, to play, pause the animation,
and to skip though parts of the scene.

It also has some tools for *Keyframes*, *Keying Sets*, and *Markers*.


Main View
=========

The main *Timeline* region displays the animation frames over time.

.. figure:: /images/timeline_main.png

   Timeline Main Area.


Adjusting the View
------------------

The *Timeline* can be panned by holding :kbd:`MMB`,
then dragging the area left or right.

You can zoom the *Timeline* by using :kbd:`Ctrl-MMB`, the mouse :kbd:`Wheel`,
or pressing :kbd:`Minus` and :kbd:`Plus` on the numpad.


Time Cursor
-----------


The *Time Cursor* is the green line, it is used to set and display the current time frame.

.. figure:: /images/timeline_cursor.png
   :align: center

   Time Cursor.


The *Time Cursor* can be set or moved to a new position by pressing or holding
:kbd:`LMB` in the Timeline editor.

The current frame or second can be displayed on the *Time Cursor*,
check the View menu for settings.

The *Time Cursor* can be moved in steps by pressing :kbd:`Left` or :kbd:`Right`,
or in steps of 10 frames by pressing :kbd:`Shift-Up` or :kbd:`Shift-Down`.


Playback/Rendering Range
------------------------

By default, the *Playback/Rendering Range* (Frame Start 1 to Frame End 200)
is a lighter shade of gray. The start and end frame can be set to the *Time Cursor*
by pressing :kbd:`S` or :kbd:`E`.
The *Playback Range* can also be set by pressing :kbd:`P` then drawing a box.


Keyframes
---------

For the active and selected objects, keyframes are displayed as a yellow line.
For *Armatures*, the object keyframes and the pose bones keyframes are drawn.

*Only Selected Channels* can be enabled. :menuselection:`Timeline --> View --> Only Selected Channels`.
For *Armatures*, this will draw the object keyframes,
and the keyframes for the active and selected pose bones.


Markers
-------

Markers are the small triangles, with their name near them.
Markers are usually used to identify key parts of the animation.

.. figure:: /images/animation_markers_standard.png

   Markers.

See the :doc:`Markers page </animation/markers>` for more information.

.. _animation-editors-timeline-headercontrols:

Header Controls
---------------

The Timeline header controls.

.. figure:: /images/editors_timeline_header.png

   Timeline header controls.

   1. Range Control, 2. Frame Control, 3. Player Control,
   4. Synchronize Playback, 5. Keyframe Control.


Range Control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use Preview Range
   This is an alternative range used to preview animations.
   This works for the UI playback, this will not work for rendering an animation.

Lock Time Cursor to Playback Range
   This limits the *Time Cursor* to the *Playback Range*.


Frame Control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Start Frame
   The start frame of the animation/playback range.
End Frame
   The end frame of the animation/playback range.
Current Frame
   The current frame of the animation/playback range.
   Also the position of the *Time Cursor*.


Player Control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These button are used to set, play, rewind, the *Time Cursor*.

.. figure:: /images/timeline_player_controls.png
   :align: right

   Player Controls.

Jump to start
   This sets the cursor to the start of frame range. :kbd:`Shift-Ctrl-Down` or :kbd:`Shift-Left`
Jump to previous keyframe
   This sets the cursor to the previous keyframe. :kbd:`Down`
Rewind
   This plays the animation sequence in reverse. :kbd:`Shift-Alt-A`
   When playing the play buttons switch to a pause button.
Play
   This plays the animation sequence. :kbd:`Alt-A`
   When playing the play buttons switch to a pause button.
Jump to next keyframe
   This sets the cursor to the next keyframe. :kbd:`Up`
Jump to end
   This sets the cursor to the end of frame range. :kbd:`Shift-Ctrl-Up` or :kbd:`Shift-Right`
Pause
   This stops the animation. :kbd:`Alt-A`


Synchronize Playback
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. figure:: /images/animation_red_fps.png
   :figwidth: 109px
   :align: right

   3D View Red FPS.

   60:54.75


When you play an animation, the FPS is displayed at the top left of the 3D View.
If the scene is detailed and playback is slower than the set
*Frame Rate* (see :ref:`render-tab-dimensions`,
these options are used to synchronize the playback.

No Sync
   Do not sync, play every frame.
Frame Dropping
   Drop frames if playback is too slow.
   This enables *Frame Dropping* from the *Playback Menu*.
AV-sync
   Sync to audio clock, dropping frames if playback is slow.
   This enables *AV-sync* and *Frame Dropping* from the *Playback Menu*.


.. _animation-editors-timeline-autokeyframe:

Keyframe Control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Auto Keyframe
   .. figure:: /images/editors_info_keyframes-auto.png
      :align: right

      Timeline Auto Keyframe.

   The "Record" red-dot button enables something called *Auto Keyframe* :
   It will add and/or replace existing keyframes for the active object when you transform it in the 3D View.

   For example, when enabled, first set the *Time Cursor* to the desired frame,
   then move an object in the 3D View, or set a new value for a property in the UI.

   When you set a new value for the properties,
   Blender will add keyframes on the current frame for the transform properties.

   Auto Keying Set
      When enabled *Auto Keyframe* will insert new keyframes for the properties in the active *Keying Set*.

   Layered
      Adds a new NLA Track and strip for every loop/pass made over the animation to allow non-distructive tweaking.

   .. note::

      Note that *Auto Keyframe* only works for transform properties (objects and bones),
      in the 3D Views (i.e. you cant use it e.g. to animate the colors of a material in the Properties editor...).

Keyframe Type
   TODO.

Active Keying Set
   .. figure:: /images/editors_info_keying-sets.png
      :align: right

      Timeline Keying Sets.

   *Keying Sets* are a set of keyframe channels in one.

   They are made so the user can record multiple properties at the same time.

   With a keying set selected, when you insert a keyframe,
   Blender will add keyframes for the properties in the active *Keying Set*.

   There are some built in keying sets, *LocRotScale*, and also custom keying sets.

   Custom keying sets can be defined in the in the panels
   :menuselection:`Properties --> Scene --> Keying Sets + Active Keying Set`.

   Insert Keyframes
      Insert keyframes on the current frame for the properties in the active *Keying Set*.
   Delete Keyframes
      Delete keyframes on the current frame for the properties in the active *Keying Set*.
