The NLA editor, short for Non-Linear Animation, can manipulate and repurpose :doc:`/animation/actions`,
without the tedium of handling keyframes. It is often used to make broad,
significant changes to a scene's animation, with relative ease.
It can also re-purpose, chain together a sequence of motions, and "layer" actions, which make it easier to organize,
and version-control your animation.
