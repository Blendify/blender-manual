   The Editor Type selection menu.

Blender provides 16 different Editor Types for displaying and modifying
different aspects of the Data. 
Editors operate mostly independent from each other. 
But it is possible to synchronize editors to update related data 
within other editors as soon as that data is changed.

It is also possible to open the same Editor type multiple times and thus
show different views on the same data in parallel.
For example you can open the 3D View (-Editor) 4 times to show
the current scene from top, front, side and Camera perspective at the same time.
