   The Editor Type selection menu.

Blender provides a number of different Editor Types for displaying and modifying different aspects of data.

It is also possible to open the same Editor type multiple times and thus
show different views on the same data in parallel.
For example you can open the 3D View Editor 4 times to show
the current scene from the top, front, side and Camera perspective at the same time.
