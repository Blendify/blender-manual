   File Browser.


Usage
=====

The file browser has multiple uses, while its often used for save/load,
it can be kept open for other uses too.

Use cases include:

- Opening and Saving Blend files.
- Import/Export other file formats.
- Picking new locations for existing file-paths (images, video's, fonts... etc).
- Browsing inside other blend-files, when using :doc:`Linked Libraries </data_system/linked_libraries>`.

You can also keep the File Browser open, as with any other editor type.
In this case the buttons to load a files is removed.

The main purpose of this is to be able to drag media files.

- Images into the :ref:`editors-sequencer-index` (to set background or apply as material textures).
- Media files into the :ref:`editors-sequencer-index`.

.. rubric:: Opening a Image Sequence

The filename of the images must contain a digit, indicating the frame.
The sequence could be opened by the selection of the images and
by the confirm with the *Open image* button or :kbd:`Return`.


Shortcuts
=========

Path Fields
-----------

Increment Filename :kbd:`Plus`, :kbd:`Minus`
   Adds or removes a trailing number to your file name.
   *(use to make *versions* of a file)*.

   When in the directory editor, this will auto-complete existing paths.

Selection
---------

(De)select All :kbd:`A`

Arrow Keys Navigation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is also possible to select/deselect files by "walking" through them using the arrow keys.

- Just using an arrow key, the next file in the chosen direction will be selected and all others deselected.
- Holding down :kbd:`Shift` while doing this does not deselect anything so it extends to the selection,
  plus it allows to deselect files by navigating into a block of already selected ones (minimum two files in sequence).
- Holding down :kbd:`Ctrl-Shift` further selects/deselects all files in-between.

If no file is selected, the arrow key navigation selects the first or last file in the directory,
depending on the arrow direction.

If you select a directory and hit enter, you will now go into that directory
(and highlighting 'parent' entry will bring you up one level).

Delete Files :kbd:`Delete`, :kbd:`X`
   Delete the currently selected files.
Rename :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB`
   Can be used on a file or directory to rename it.

System
   The system menu contains a list of drives that are available
   to navigate through to find files. Click on one to jump to that drive.

Bookmarks

   then click the *Add* button.
   To remove a folder from the list, simply click the *X* icon next to it.
