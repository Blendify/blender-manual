   The File Browser.


Usage
=====

The File Browser is used in all the file-related operations.
It has multiple use cases, while its often used for save/load.

These include:

- Opening and Saving Blend files.
- Import/Export other file formats.
- Picking new locations for existing file-paths (images, video, fonts...).
- Browsing inside other blend-files, when using :doc:`Linked Libraries </data_system/linked_libraries>`.

You can also keep the File Browser open, as with any other editor type,
to browse through the file system. In this case, confirm/cancel buttons will be absent.

The main purpose of this is to be able to drag media files:

- Images into the :ref:`editors-sequencer-index` (to set background or apply as material textures).
- Media files into the :ref:`editors-sequencer-index`.

On the other hand, if the File Browser is opened for a file action (opening, saving, importing, etc.),
it will appear maximized and waiting for an operation to complete before returning to the former screen layout.


.. _file-browser-open-sequence:

Opening an Image Sequence
-------------------------

The filename of the images must contain a digit, indicating the frame.
The sequence could be opened by the selection of the images and
by the confirmation with the *Open Image* button or :kbd:`Return`.

.. To load image sequence in any of the supported image
   file formats, first click on the first frame and then Accept.
   Then change the Source to Image Sequence, and enter the ending frame number of this sequence.

The system panel contains a list of drives that are available
to navigate through to find files.

Main Region
===========

Navigation
----------

Entering a Directory
   A single :kbd:`LMB` click on a directory enters that directory.
Parent Directory :kbd:`Backspace`, :kbd:`P`
   Takes you up one level of directory.


Arrow Keys
^^^^^^^^^^

Directory navigation is also possible through the arrow keys with :kbd:`Alt` pressed:

- Go to Parent :kbd:`Alt-Up`
- Previous :kbd:`Alt-Left`
- Next Directory :kbd:`Alt-Right`


File Drop
^^^^^^^^^

You now can simply drag & drop files from your local file explorer into the blender file browser.
This will relocate the File browser to the directory of the dropped file and the file will be selected.


Selection
---------

Select
   Both :kbd:`LMB` and :kbd:`RMB` works.
(De)select All :kbd:`A`
   Toggles selecting all files.
Dragging
   Dragging with :kbd:`LMB` starts a :ref:`border selection <select-border>`.


Arrow Keys
^^^^^^^^^^

It is also possible to select/deselect files by "walking" through them using the arrow keys:

- Just using an arrow key, the next file in the chosen direction will be selected and all others deselected.
- Holding down :kbd:`Shift` while doing this does not deselect anything so it extends to the selection,
  plus it allows to deselect files by navigating into a block
  of already selected ones (minimum two files in sequence).
- Holding down :kbd:`Ctrl-Shift` further selects/deselects all files in-between.

If no file is selected, the arrow key navigation selects the first or last file in the directory,
depending on the arrow direction.

If you select a directory and hit :kbd:`Enter`, you will go into that directory
(and highlighting 'parent' entry will bring you up one level).


File Management
---------------

Delete Files :kbd:`Delete`, :kbd:`X`
   Delete the currently selected files.
Rename :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB`
   Can be used on a file or directory to rename it.
