Enables you to quickly set common image pre-processing options.


Video
=====

Strobe
   To only display each nth frame. For example, if you set this to 10,
   the strip will only display frames 1, 11, 21, 31, 41... of the source.
   *Strobe* is a float value -- this way you can get a strobe effect synced exactly to a beat,
   for example, by using non-integer values.
Flip
   Flips (mirrors) the image.

   - X: left-to-right
   - Y: top-to-bottom

Backwards
   Plays the strip in reverse (time).
Deinterlace
   Removes fields in a video file.
   In example if it is a broadcast video and it has even or odd interlacing fields.


Colors
======

Saturation
   Increase or decrease the saturation of an image.
Multiply
   Multiplies the colors by this value. This will increases the brightness.

Convert Float
   Converts input to float data.
