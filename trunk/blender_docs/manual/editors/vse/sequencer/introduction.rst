Introduction

The Marker menu allows you to add markers in the VSE.
Markers are shared across animation editors. See :doc:`Markers </animation/markers>`

The sequencer workspace is horizontally striped into channels and each video strip will go in
a horizontal channel. Each channel is numbered on the left-hand side, starting from zero and going up.

.. note::

   The first channel 0 is unusable as a place to put strips.
   This is because it is used by the :doc:`Sequencer Display </editors/vse/preview/introduction>`
   to show a composite of all strips above channel 0.

Stripes toward the bottom are more dominant, which we will get to in a minute.
In the x direction, seconds of animation or frames of animation,

:kbd:`Ctrl-T` to choose, are used as the measure of time (seconds 1 through 7 are shown).

You can scale the time using the zoom keys or mouse actions (see the Reference for more info).

.. note::

   By default the Sequencer is enabled however, it can be disabled
   in the :doc:`Post Processing Panel </render/post_process/panel>`.
