Introduction

In addition to modeling and animation, Blender can be used to edit video.
There are two possible methods for this one being the :doc:`Compositor </compositing/introduction>`.
However, this chapter is on the other, the Video Sequence Editor (VSE) and some time shorten to just Sequencer.
The Sequencer within Blender is a complete video editing system that allows you to combine multiple
video channels and add effects to them. You can use these effects to create powerful video edits
(especially when you combine it with the animation power of Blender!).

To use the VSE, you load multiple video clips and lay them end-to-end (or in some cases, overlay them),
inserting fades and transitions to link the end of one clip to the beginning of another.
Finally, you can audio and synchronize the timing of the video sequence to match it.

View Types
==========

The Video Sequence Editor has a header (where the menu and view modes are shown) and a workspace,
and works in one of several view modes.

The view types toggles in the header allow to change the view of the VSE. By default,
only the sequencer is displayed. The second button displays only the Preview region,
and the third button displays both the Sequencer and the Preview.
