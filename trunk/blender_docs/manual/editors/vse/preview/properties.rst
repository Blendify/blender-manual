Scene Preview/Render
====================

OpenGL Preview
   When enabled :doc:`Scene Strips </editors/vse/sequencer/strips/scene>`
   use a quick OpenGL preview (see :doc:`OpenGL render </render/opengl>` for more on this subject).

   Otherwise a full render is used, which can be very slow.

   Sequencer Preview Shading
      Method for rendering OpenGL renders.
   Textured Solid
      Display textures even when in solid mode.

   Settings used by OpenGL Previews:

   - The anti-alias setting from the active scene is used for all scenes.
   - The alpha setting is taken from each scene,
     where *Sky* fills in a solid background and *Transparent* has a transparent background.


View Settings
=============

Show Overexposed
   Shows overexposed (bright white) areas using a zebra pattern.
   The threshold can be adjust with the slider.
Proxy Render Size
   Size to display proxies at in the preview region.
   Using a smaller preview size will increase speed.


Safe Areas
==========

Shows guides used to position elements to ensure that the
most important parts of the video can be seen across all screens.
