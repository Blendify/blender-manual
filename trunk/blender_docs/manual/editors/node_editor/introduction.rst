   The Node Editor.

The *Node Editor* is used to work with node-based work flows.
The node tree type can be changed using the buttons in the node editor header.
However, here we will only give an overview of what the *Node Editor* is.
In the list below it shows a list of different types of node trees and where each is documented.

       </render/blender_render/materials/nodes/index>` and :doc:`Cycles </render/cycles/nodes/index>`.

The *toolshelf* is a context-sensitive region, natively containing tools for the grease pencil and buttons for adding
nodes. The toolshelf is organized using tabs.

Properties Region
-----------------

The *properties region* contains properties for the current selected node as well as node editor specific settings.

Header
------

The *header* contains various menus, buttons and options, partially based on the current node tree type.
