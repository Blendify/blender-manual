Reroute Node
************

A node used primarily for organization.
Reroute looks and behaves much like a socket on other nodes in that it supports one input
connection while allowing multiple output connections.

To quickly add a Reroute node into an existing connection, hold :kbd:`Shift` and :kbd:`LMB`
while sweeping across the link to add a *Reroute node*.
