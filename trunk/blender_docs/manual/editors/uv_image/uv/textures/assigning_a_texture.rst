Creating a New Texture Data-block in a new Texture Slot
=======================================================

Select an empty slot, then click on the *New* button.

This will do two things:

#. It will create a new texture data-block.
#. Also, it will add a new slot in the textures stack.


Creating a New Texture Data-block in a Non-empty Slot
=====================================================

Select a non-empty slot, then click on the *Plus* button.

This will do two things:

#. It will create a new texture data-block, with a new name, by
   making a copy of the texture data-block assigned to the selected slot.
#. It will assign this new data-block to the selected slot.


Sharing a Texture Data-Block in a Non-empty Slot
================================================

- Select a non-empty slot, then click on the *Browse* button.
  This will open a menu showing all the available Texture data-blocks in this file.
- Choose a texture data-block in the menu to assign it to the selected slot.
  This will share the chosen texture with more than one object,
  hence the *Number of users* shown in the texture data-block will increase by one.
