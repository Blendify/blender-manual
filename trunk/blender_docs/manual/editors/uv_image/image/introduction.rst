When a rendered image is displayed in the UV/Image Editor,

   You can save successive renders into the render buffer by selecting a new slot before rendering.
   If an image has been rendered to a slot, it can be viewed by selecting that slot.
   Empty slots appear as blank grids in the UV/Image editor.
   Use the :kbd:`J` and :kbd:`Alt-J` to cycle forwards and backwards through saved renders.
