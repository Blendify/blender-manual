Histogram
=========

.. copied from the sequencer.

This mode displays a graph showing the distribution of color information in the pixels of the
currently displayed image. The X-axis represents values of pixel, from 0 to 1 (or 0 to 255),
while the Y-axis represents the number of pixels in that tonal range. A predominantly dark
image would have most of its information toward the left side of the graph.

Use this mode to balance out the tonal range in an image.
A well balanced image should a nice smooth distribution of color values.

Luma
   Shows the luminosity of an image.
RGB
   Shows the :abbr:`RGB (Red, Green, Blue)` channels stacked on top of each other.
R/G/B/A
   Depending on the channel you choose the scope will show the appropriate channel.
Show line
   Displays lines rather then filled shapes.


Waveform
========

.. Add description of a Waveform maybe this should go in the glossary? (TODO).

Waveform Opacity
   Opacity of the points.

Waveform Mode
   Luma
      ToDo.
   Parade
      The RGB channels are shown side-by-side.
   Red Green Blue
      Shows the RGB channels overlaid as a "Full color" waveform.
      It is useful for color grading.


Vectorscope
===========

.. Add description of a Vectorscope maybe this should go in the glossary? (TODO).

Vectorscope Opacity
   Opacity of the points.


Sample Line
===========

The *Sample Line* scope is the same as the `Histogram`_
but allows you to get the sample data from a line.

Sample Line
   Used to draw a line to use to read the sample data from.


Scope Samples
=============

Full Sample
   Sample every pixel.

Accuracy
   Proportion of original image source pixel lines to sample.
