See about supported :doc:`/data_system/files/media/image_formats`.


Single Image
------------

Still image or a single frame.


Image Sequence
--------------

Each frame is stored in a separate file.
How to load a :ref:`file-browser-open-sequence`.

Frame
   A label showing the current frame.
Further options
   See `Movie`_ below.


Movie
-----

Frames packed into a container.

Deinterlace
   TODO
Fields
   Sets the number of fields per rendered frame (2 fields is 1 frame).
   Used with Fields and interlaced video,
   it says whether each image has both odd and even, or just one.
Frame
   Frames
      Sets the range of frames to use.
   Start
      Global starting frame of the sequence, when the playback should start.
      This is a global setting which means it affects all clip users such as the Movie clip editor itself,
      motion tracking constraints and compositor nodes.
   Offset
      Offsets the first frame of the clip. It adds an extra offset to the frame number when
      converting a scene frame to the frame number in the file name.
      This option does not affect tracking data or any other associated data.
Match Movie Length
   This button set image's user's length to the one of selected movie.
Auto Refresh
   Automatically refresh images on frame changes.
Cyclic
   Start over and repeats after the last frame to create a continuous loop.

Generated
---------

Image generated in Blender or preloaded.

          Image panel for Generated source.

          The New Image pop-up menu.

Width, Height
   The size of image in pixels.
Color
   Sets the fill color if creating a blank image.
32 bit Float/ Float Buffer
   Creates a 32 bit image. This is a larger file size,
   but holds much more color information than the standard 8 bit image.
   For close ups and large gradients, it may be better to use a 32 bit image.
Type
   Blank
      Creates a Blank image of a single specified color.
   UV Grid
      Creates a checkerboard pattern with a colored cross (+) in each square.
   Color Grid
      Creates a more complex colored grid with letters and numbers denoting locations in the grid.
      It could be used for testing how the UVs have been mapped and to reduce stretching or distortion.


Common Options
==============

File
   Use for replacing or packing files.

   Pack
      Embed the resource into the current blend-file.
   Path
      Path to the linked file.
   Open
      Opens the :doc:`/editors/file_browser/index` to select a file from a drive.
   Reload
      Reloads the file. Useful when a file has been rework in an external application.
Color Space
   :term:`Color Space`.

   XYZ
      XYZ space.
   VD16
      The simple video conversion from a gamma 2.2 sRGB space.
   sRGB
      Standard RGB display space.
   Raw
      Raw space.
   Non-Color
      Color space used for images which contains non-color data (e.g. normal maps).
   Linear ACES
      ACES linear space.
   Linear
      Linear 709 (full range). Blender native linear space.
View as Render
   Apply render part of display transformation when displaying this image on the screen.
Use Multi-View
   See :doc:`Multi-View </render/workflows/multiview/index>`.
Use Alpha
   Determines whether the alpha channel of the image is used.

   Alpha Mode
      :term:`Alpha Channel`.

      Straight, Premultiplied

Fields
   Work with :doc:`/render/blender_render/post_processing/fields` images.
   Video frames consist of two different images (fields) that are merged.
   This option ensures that when fields are rendered,
   the correct field of the image is used in the correct field of the rendering.
   *MIP Mapping* cannot be combined with *Fields*. Order of video fields:

   Upper First, Lower First.
