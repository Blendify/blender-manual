Gravity
*******

Gravity is a global setting that is applied the same to all physics systems in a scene,
which can be found in the scene tab. This value is generally fine left at its default value,
at -9.810 in the Z-Axis, which is the force of gravity in the real world.
Lowering this value would simulate a lower or higher force of gravity.
Gravity denoted g, measurement *m* × *s*\ :sup:`-2`\).

Gravity is practically same around whole *Earth*.
For rendering scenes from *Moon* use value six times smaller, e.g. 1.622 *m* × *s*\ :sup:`-2`\.
The *Mars* has g = 3.69.

.. note::

   The gravity value per physics system can be scale down in the *Field Weights tab*.
