Hair Dynamics
*************

Hair particles can now be made dynamic using Cloth physics.

To enable hair physics, click the check box beside *Hair Dynamics*.


Material
========

Stiffness
   Controls how stiff the root of the hair strands are.
Mass
   Controls the mass of the cloth material.
Bending
   Controls the amount of bend along the hairs. Higher values cause less bending.
Internal Friction
   Amount of friction between individual hairs.
Collider Friction
   Amount of friction between hairs and external collision objects.


Damping
=======

Spring
   Damping of cloth velocity. (higher = more smooth, less jiggling).
Air
   Air has normally some thickness which slows falling things down.


Quality
=======

Steps
   Quality of the simulation in steps per frame. (higher is better quality but slower).


Simulation
==========

TODO.

.. warning::
   If you use motion blur in your animation,
   you will need to bake one extra frame past the last frame which you will be rendering.
