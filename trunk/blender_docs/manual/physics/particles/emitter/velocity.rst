   Initial velocity.


The initial velocity of particles can be set through different parameters,
based on the type of the particle system (see Particle System tab).
If the particle system type is Emitter or Hair,
then the following parameters give the particle an initial velocity in the direction of...


Emitter Geometry
================

Normal
   The emitter's surface normals (i.e. let the surface normal give the particle a starting speed).
Tangent
   Let the tangent speed give the particle a starting speed.
Rot
   Rotates the surface tangent.


Emitter Object
==============

Align
   Give an initial velocity in the X, Y, and Z axes.

   X, Y, Z
Object
   The emitter objects movement (i.e. let the object give the particle a starting speed).
Random
   Gives the starting speed a random variation.
   You can use a texture to only change the value, see Controlling Emission, Interaction and Time).
