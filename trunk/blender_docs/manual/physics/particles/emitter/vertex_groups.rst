   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Particle System --> Vertex Groups`

The Vertex groups panel allows you to specify vertex groups to use for several child particle settings.
You can also negate the effect of each vertex group with the checkboxes.
You can affect the following attributes:

Density
   Defines the density of the particle distribution.
Length
   Defines the length of the hair.
Clump
   Controls amount of clumping.
   The weight of 1.0 gives current *Clump* value, weight of 0.0 completely removes effect.
Kink
   Controls frequency of the children Kink.
Roughness 1
   Adjusts the Roughness: *Uniform* parameter.
Roughness 2
   Adjusts the Roughness: *Random* parameter.
Roughness End
   Adjusts the Roughness: *Endpoint* parameter.
Twist
   Vertex group to control children's *Twist* effect.
   Gives a control over direction of twist and amount of twist as well.
   The weight of 0.5 is neutral, i.e. there is no twist effect.
