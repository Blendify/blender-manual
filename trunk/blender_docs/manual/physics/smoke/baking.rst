   *Smoke Cache* options.

:term:`Baking` is used to store the outcome of a simulation so it doesn't need to be recalculated.

Smoke baking settings are in :menuselection:`Properties --> Physics --> Smoke --> Smoke Cache`.
See :doc:`Baking </physics/baking>` for more information.

.. note::

   Baking can only been done once your .blend is saved.
   If your .blend has not been saved, the *Smoke Cache* panel will be disabled.
