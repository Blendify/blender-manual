Introduction
************

Smoke simulation is used to simulate the fluid movement of air and generate animated :term:`voxel`
textures representing the density, heat, and velocity of other fluids or suspended particles
(i.e. smoke) which can be used for rendering.

.. add pretty smoke/fire render here?

Smoke and fire are emitted into a :doc:`Domain </physics/smoke/types/domain>`
from a mesh object or particle system. Smoke movement is controlled by airflow inside the domain,
which can be influenced by :doc:`smoke collision objects </physics/smoke/types/collisions>`.
Smoke will also be affected by scene gravity and :doc:`force fields </physics/force_fields/index>`.
Airflow inside the domain can affect other physics simulations via the smoke flow force field.


Workflow
========

At least a :doc:`Domain Object </physics/smoke/types/domain>` object and
one :doc:`Flow object </physics/smoke/types/flow_object>` are required to create a smoke simulation.
A basic workflow looks like this:

#. Create a :doc:`Domain Object </physics/smoke/types/domain>`
   that defines the bounds of the simulation volume.
#. Define a :doc:`Flow object </physics/smoke/types/flow_object>`
   or objects which will emit smoke and fire.
#. Set :doc:`Collision objects </physics/smoke/types/collisions>`
   to make the smoke interact with objects in the scene.
#. Assign a :doc:`Volumetric material </physics/smoke/material>`
   to the domain object.
#. Save the blend-file.
#. :doc:`Bake </physics/smoke/baking>`
   the simulation.

.. note::

   There is a *Quick Smoke* operator which will automatically create a domain object with a basic smoke/fire material.
   It can be found in :menuselection:`3D View --> Object --> Quick Effects --> Quick Smoke`,
   or in the :kbd:`Spacebar` search box.


Technical information
=====================

Blender's smoke simulation is based on the paper
`Wavelet Turbulence for Fluid Simulation <https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~tedkim/wturb>`__
and associated sample code.

It has been implemented in Blender by Daniel Genrich and Miika Hamalainen.
