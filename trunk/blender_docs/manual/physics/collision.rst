:doc:`Particles </physics/particles/index>`, :doc:`Soft Bodies </physics/soft_body/index>`
and :doc:`Cloth objects </physics/cloth/index>` may collide with mesh objects.
:doc:`Boids </physics/particles/emitter/physics/boids>` try to avoid *Collision* objects.

- You may limit the effect on particles to a group of objects
  (in the :doc:`Field Weights panel </physics/particles/emitter/force_field>`).
- *Deflection* for soft body objects is difficult, they often penetrate the colliding objects.
- Hair particles ignore deflecting objects
  (but you can animate them as soft bodies which take deflection into account).

If you change the deflection settings for an object you have to recalculate the particle,
soft body or cloth system by *Delete Bake*, this is not done automatically.

   Collision panel.


Force Field
-----------

Field Absorption
   A deflector can also deflect effectors. You can specify some collision/deflector objects which deflect a specific
   portion of the effector force using the *Field Absorption* value. 100% absorption results in no force getting
   through the collision/deflector object at all. If you have three collision object behind each other with e.g.
   10%, 43% and 3%, the absorption ends up at around 50% :math:`100 × (1 - 0.1) × (1 - 0.43) × (1 - 0.03)`.


Particle
--------

Permeability
   Fraction of particles passing through the mesh.
Stickiness
   How much particles stick to the object.
Kill Particles
   Deletes Particles upon impact.

Damping
   Damping during a collision (independent of the velocity of the particles).

   Randomize
      Random variation of damping.

Friction
   Friction during movements along the surface.

   Randomize
      Random variation of friction.


Softbody and Cloth
-------------------

Damping
   Damping during a collision.
   The amount of bounce that surfaces will have.

   - 0.0 - No damping, soft bodies will have a maximum bounciness.
   - 1.0 - Maximum damping, soft bodies will not bounce at all.

Thickness
   A padding distance is added to the inside and outside of each face, to help to prevent intersections.
   The soft body will come to rest at this distance away from the face of the colliding object.
   Outside and inside is defined by the face normal, depicted as blue arrow in Fig. :ref:`fig-collision-soft-plane`.

   Outer
      Size of the outer collision zone.
   Inner
      Size of the inner collision zone (padding distance).

.. _fig-collision-soft-plane:

.. figure:: /images/physics_collision_outer-inner.png
   :width: 380px

   A soft body vertex colliding with a plane.

Friction
   Friction for cloth collisions.

Single Sided
   When enabled, cloth collisions are only performed on the normal side of the collider plane.

Override Normals
   When enabled, cloth collision impulses act in the direction of the collider normals.


*Soft body* collisions are difficult to get perfect. If one of the objects move too fast,
the soft body will penetrate the mesh. See also the section about :doc:`Soft Bodies </physics/soft_body/index>`.


Examples
========

.. figure:: /images/physics_collision_defected-particles.png

   Deflected particles.

Here is a *Meta* object, dupliverted to a particle system emitting downwards, and deflected by a mesh cube.


Hints
=====

- Make sure that the normals of the mesh surface are facing towards the particles/points for correct deflection.
- Hair particles react directly to force fields,
  so if you use a force field with a short range you do not need necessarily collision.
- Hair particles avoid their emitting mesh if you edit them in *Particle Edit Mode*.
  So you can at least model the hair with collision.
