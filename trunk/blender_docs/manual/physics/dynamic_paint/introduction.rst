Introduction
************

Dynamic paint is a new modifier and physics system that can turn objects into paint canvases
and brushes, creating vertex colors, image sequences or displacement.
This makes many effects possible that were previously difficult to achieve,
for example footsteps in the snow, raindrops that make the ground wet,
paint that sticks to walls, or objects that gradually freeze.

This guide explains the very basics of Dynamic Paint user interface and general features.

   How to activate the Dynamic Paint


Activating the modifier
=======================

Dynamic Paint can be activated from the "Physics" tab of the "Properties" editor.


Types
=====

Modifier itself has two different types:

:doc:`Canvas </physics/dynamic_paint/canvas>`
   Makes object receive paint from Dynamic Paint brushes.

:doc:`Brush </physics/dynamic_paint/brush>`
   Makes object apply paint on the canvas.


.. note::

   You can also enable brush and canvas simultaneously.
   In that case same object's "brush" doesn't influence it's "canvas",
   but can still interact with other objects in the scene.
