Mass
   The mass of the cloth material.
Air Viscosity
   Air has some thickness which slows falling things down.
Bending Model
   Linear
      Cloth model with linear bending springs (old).
   Angular
      Cloth model with angular bending springs.


Stiffness
=========

   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Physics --> Cloth --> Physical Properties --> Stiffness`

Tension
   How much the material resists stretching.
Compression
   How much the material resists compression.
Structural
   Overall stiffness of the cloth (only in linear bending model).
Shear
   How much the material resists shearing.
Bending
   Wrinkle coefficient. Higher creates more large folds.


Damping
=======

Tension
   Amount of damping in stretching behavior.
Compression
   Amount of damping in compression behavior.
Structural
   Amount of damping in stretching behavior (only in linear bending model).
Shear
