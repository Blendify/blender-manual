The first thing you need when pinning cloth is
a :doc:`Vertex Group </modeling/meshes/properties/vertex_groups/index>`.
There are several ways of doing this including using the Weight Paint tool to paint the areas you want to pin
(see the :doc:`/sculpt_paint/weight_paint/index` section of the manual).
The weight of each vertex in the group controls how strongly it is pinned.

      Cloth pinning.

Once you have a vertex group set, things are pretty straightforward; all you have to do is
press the *Pinning* button in the *Cloth* panel and select which
vertex group you want to use, and the stiffness you want it at.

Stiffness
   Target position stiffness. You can leave the stiffness as it is; the default value of 1 is fine.

Sewing Force
   Maximum force that can be applied by sewing springs. Zero means unbounded, but it is not
   recommended to leave the field at zero in most cases, as it can cause instability due to
   extreme forces in the initial frames where the ends of the sewing springs are far apart.

   Another method of restraining cloth similar to pinning is sewing springs.
   Sewing springs are virtual springs that pull vertices in one part of
   a cloth mesh toward vertices in another part of the cloth mesh.
   This is different from pinning which binds vertices of the cloth mesh in place or to another object.
   A clasp on a cloak could be created with a sewing spring.
   The spring could pull two corners of a cloak about a character's neck.
   This could result in a more realistic simulation than pinning the cloak to
   the character's neck since the cloak would be free to slide about the character's neck and shoulders.

   Sewing springs are created by adding extra edges to a cloth mesh that are not included in any faces.
   They should connect vertices in the mesh that should be pulled together.
   For example the corners of a cloak.

Shrinking Factor
   Factor by which to shrink the cloth.

Dynamic Mesh
   Dynamic Mesh allows animating the rest shape of cloth using shape keys or
   modifiers (e.g. an Armature modifier or any deformation modifier) placed above the Cloth modifier.
   When it is enabled, the rest shape is recalculated every frame, allowing unpinned
   cloth to squash and stretch following the character with the help of shape keys or modifiers, but
   otherwise move freely under control of the physics simulation.

   Normally cloth uses the state of the object in the first frame to compute
   the natural rest shape of the cloth, and keeps that constant throughout the simulation.
   This is reasonable for fully realistic scenes, but does not quite work for clothing
   on cartoon style characters that use a lot of squash and stretch.


Pinning Clothing to an Armature
===============================

Clothing can be simulated and pinned to an armature.
For example, a character could have a baggy tunic pinned to the character's waist with a belt.

The typical workflow for pinning:

#. Set the armature to its bind pose.
#. Model clothing that encloses but does not penetrate the character's mesh.
#. Parent the clothing objects to the armature. The armature will now have several child meshes bound to it.
#. Create a new vertex group on each cloth object for its pinned vertices.
#. Add vertices to be pinned to this vertex group and give these vertices non-zero weights
   (you probably want weight = 1).
   For example the belt area of the tunic would be in the vertex group and have weight one.
#. Designate the clothing objects as "cloth" in the Physics tab of the Properties editor.
   Make sure the Cloth Modifier is below the Armature Modifier in the modifier stack.
#. Press the *Pinning of Cloth* button in the *Cloth* panel and select the vertex group.
#. Designate the character's mesh as "collision" object in the Physics tab of the Properties editor.
#. The clothing is now ready. Non-pinned vertices will be under control of the Cloth modifier.
   Pinned vertices will be under control of the Armature modifier.

.. note::

   When animating or posing the character you must begin from the bind pose.
   Move the character to its initial pose over several frames so the physics engine can simulate the clothing moving.
   Very fast movements and teleport jumps can break the physics simulation.

.. Note that if you move the cloth object ''after'' you have already run some simulations,
   you must unprotect and clear the cache; otherwise, Blender will use the position of
   the current/cached mesh's vertices when trying to represent where they are.
   Editing the shape of the mesh, after simulation, is also discussed below.
   You may disable the cloth and edit the mesh as a normal mesh editing process.
   This is jumping ahead and not clear and not true at this point.

   Finally, use the Timeline editor Play button,
   or press :kbd:`Alt-A` in the 3D View to run the simulation.
   Your cloth will fall and interact with Deflection objects as it would in the real world.
