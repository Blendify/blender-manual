This field is a very short range force with a behavior determined by the sizes of the effector
and effected particle. At a distance smaller than the combined sizes the field is very
repulsive and after that distance it's attractive.
It tries to keep the particles at an equilibrium distance from each other.
Particles need to be at a close proximity to each other to be effected by this field at all.

Particles can have for example both a charge and a Lennard-Jones potential - which is probably
something for the nuclear physicists amongst us.
