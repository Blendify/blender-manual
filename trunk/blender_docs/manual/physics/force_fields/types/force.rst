Force
*****

The *Force* field is the simplest of the fields. It gives a constant force towards
(positive strength) or away from (negative strength) the object's center.
Newtonian particles are attracted to a field with negative strength,
and are blown away from a field with positive strength.

For :doc:`Boids </physics/particles/physics/index>` a field with positive strength can be used as a *Goal*,
a field with negative strength can be used as *Predator*.
Whether *Boids* seek or fly goals/predators depends on the *Physics* settings of the Boids.
