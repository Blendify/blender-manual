Stroke

   Stroke Panel.

Stroke Method :kbd:`E`
   Defines the way brush strokes are applied to the canvas.

   Dots
      Apply paint on each mouse move step.
   Drag Dot
      Leaves only one dab on the canvas which can be placed by dragging.
   Space
      Creates brush stroke as a series of dots,
      whose distance (spacing) is determined by the *Spacing* setting.

      Spacing
         Represents the percentage of the brush radius.
         Limit brush application to the distance specified by spacing.
   Airbrush
      Flow of the brush continues as long as the mouse click is held (spray),
      determined by the *Rate* setting.
      With others methods the brush only modifies the color when the brush changes its location.
      This option is not available for the *Grab* sculpting brush.

      Rate
         Interval between paints for airbrush.
   Anchored
      Creates a single dab at the brush location.
      Clicking and dragging will resize the dab diameter.

      Edge to Edge
         The brush location and orientation is determined by a two point circle,
         where the first click is one point, and dragging places the second point, opposite from the first.
   Line
      Clicking and dragging lets you define a line in screen space.
      The line dabs are separated by *Spacing*, similar to space strokes.
      With :kbd:`Alt` the line stroke is constrained to 45 degree increments.
   Curve
      Defines a curve in screen space. Curve strokes also uses *Spacing*.

      Paint Curves
         Stroke Curves are reusable and can be stored and selected by using the :ref:`ui-data-block` menu.
      Add Points :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB`
         You can define additional curve control points by using :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB`.
         The handles can define by dragging the mouse before releasing the mouse button.
      Transforming Points
         The control points and handles can be dragged around with :kbd:`LMB`.
         To ensure the handles of a control point are symmetrical,
         drag them around using :kbd:`Shift-LMB`.
         A few transform operators are supported such as grabbing, scaling and rotating.
      Selection
         The handles can be selected individually by using :kbd:`RMB`,
         extend the selection by :kbd:`Shift-RMB` and deselect/select all by using :kbd:`A`.
      Delete Points :kbd:`X`
          To delete a curve point, use :kbd:`X`.
      Draw Curve :kbd:`Enter`
         To confirm and execute the curved stroke,
         press :kbd:`Enter` or use the Draw Curve button.

Jitter
   Jitter the position of the brush while painting.
Smooth stroke :kbd:`Shift-S`
   Brush lags behind mouse and follows a smoother path.

   Radius
      Sets the minimum distance from the last point before stroke continues.
   Factor
      Sets the amount of smoothing.
Input Samples
   Recent mouse locations (input samples) are averaged together to smooth brush strokes.


Curve
=====

The Curve allows you to control the *Strength* falloff of the brush.
The falloff is mapped from the center of the brush (left part of the curve)
towards its borders (right part of the curve).
Changing the shape of the curve will make the brush softer or harder.
Read more about using the :ref:`ui-curve-widget`.
