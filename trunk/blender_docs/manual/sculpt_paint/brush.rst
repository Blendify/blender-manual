Brushes
   :ref:`ui-data-block` to select a preset Brush Types or a custom brush.
   They are a combination of a 'tool', along with stroke, texture, and options.

   The brush can be selected by numbers:
   :kbd:`0` to :kbd:`9` and :kbd:`Shift-0` to :kbd:`Shift-9`.

   Add ``+``
      When you add a brush, the new brush is a clone of the current one.

.. note::

   In order to save in a blend-user a custom brush, set a Fake User.

- Increase/decrease brush size :kbd:`[` and :kbd:`]`


Radial Control
==============

- Set brush size :kbd:`F`
- Set brush strength :kbd:`Shift-F`
- Rotate brush texture :kbd:`Ctrl-F`

You can then either adjust the value interactively or by typing in numbers.
After pressing the hotkey move the mouse to increase/reduce the value
(additionally with precision and/or snapping activated).
Finally confirm (:kbd:`LMB`, :kbd:`Return`) or cancel (:kbd:`RMB`, :kbd:`Esc`).
