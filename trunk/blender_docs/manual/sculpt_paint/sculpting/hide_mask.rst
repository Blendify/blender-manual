Hiding & Masking
****************

It is sometimes useful to isolate parts of a mesh to sculpt on. To hide a part of a mesh,
press :kbd:`H` then click & drag around the part you want to hide.
To reveal a hidden part of a mesh,
press :kbd:`Shift-H` then click & drag around the part you want to reveal.
To reveal all hidden parts, just press :kbd:`Alt-H`.
With the mask brush we can paint a part of the mesh and hide it.
