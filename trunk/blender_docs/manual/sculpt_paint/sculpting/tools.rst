Brushes are brush presets. They are a combination of a 'tool',
along with stroke, texture, and options.
The brush cab be selected by number:
:kbd:`0` to :kbd:`9` and :kbd:`Shift-0` to :kbd:`Shift-9`.

   Sculpt brushes.

Blob
   Pushes mesh outward or inward into a spherical shape with settings to
   control the amount of pinching at the edge of the sphere.
Clay :kbd:`C`
   Similar to the *Draw* brush, but includes settings to adjust the plane on which the brush acts.
Clay Strips
   Similar to the *Clay* brush, but it uses a cube test to define the brush area of influence rather than a sphere.
Crease :kbd:`Shift-C`
   Creates sharp indents or ridges by pushing or pulling the mesh, while pinching the vertices together.
Fill/Deepen
   Works like the Flatten brush, but only brings vertices below the brush plane upwards.
   The inverse of the Scrape brush is to *Deepen* by pushing vertices above the plane downward.
Flatten/Contrast :kbd:`Shift-T`
   The *Flatten* brush finds an 'area plane'
   located by default at the average height above/below the vertices within the brush area.
   The vertices are then pulled towards this plane.
   The inverse of the Flatten brush is the *Contrast*
   brush which pushes vertices up or down away from the brush plane.
Grab :kbd:`G`
   Used to drag a group of points around. Unlike the other brushes,
   *Grab* does not modify different points as the brush is dragged across the model.
   Instead, *Grab* selects a group of vertices on mousedown, and pulls them to follow the mouse.
   The effect is similar to moving a group of vertices in *Edit Mode* with proportional-editing enabled,
   except that *Grab* can make use of other Sculpt Mode options (like textures and symmetry).
Inflate/Deflate :kbd:`I`
   Similar to *Draw*, except that vertices in *Inflate* mode are displaced in the direction of their own normals.
Layer :kbd:`L`
   This brush is similar to *Draw*, except that the height of the displacement layer is capped.
   This creates the appearance of a solid layer being drawn.
   This brush does not draw on top of itself; a brush stroke intersects itself.
   Releasing the mouse button and starting a new stroke
   will reset the depth and paint on top of the previous stroke.
Mask :kbd:`M`
   ToDo.
Nudge
   Moves vertices in the direction of the brush stroke.
Pinch/Magnify :kbd:`P`
   Pulls vertices towards the center of the brush.
   The inverse setting is *Magnify*, in which vertices are pushed away from the center of the brush.
Rotate
   Rotates vertices within the brush in the direction the cursor is moved.
Scrape/Peaks
   The *Scrape* brush works like the Flatten brush, but only brings vertices above the plane downwards.
   The inverse of the Scrape brush is to *Peak* by pushing vertices above the plane up away from the plane.
SculptDraw :kbd:`X`
   Moves vertices inward or outward,
   based the average normal of the vertices contained within the drawn brush stroke.
Smooth :kbd:`S`
   As the name suggests,
   eliminates irregularities in the area of the mesh within the brush's
   influence by smoothing the positions of the vertices.
Snake Hook :kbd:`K`
   Pulls vertices along with the movement of the brush to create long, snake-like forms.

   Pinch
      Snake-hook tended to loose volume along the stroke,
      with pinch > 0.5 its possible to sculpt shapes without loosing volume
   Rake
      A factor to support grabbing the mesh with rotation following the cursors motion.
Thumb
   Similar to the *Nudge* brush, this one flattens the mesh in the brush area,
   while moving it in the direction of the brush stroke.


Common Options
--------------

Radius
   This option controls the radius of the brush, measured in pixels.
   :kbd:`F` allows you to change the brush size interactively by
   dragging the mouse and then :kbd:`LMB` (the texture of the brush should be visible inside the circle).
   Typing a number then enter while using :kbd:`F` allows you to enter the size numerically.
   Brush size can be affected by enabling the pressure sensitivity icon,
   if you are using a :ref:`Graphics Tablet <hardware-tablet>`.
Strength
   Controls how much each application of the brush affects the model.
   For example, higher values cause the *Draw* brush to add depth to the model more quickly,
   and cause the *Smooth* brush to smooth the model more quickly.
   This setting is not available for *Grab*, *Snake Hook*, or *Rotate*.

   You can change the brush strength interactively by pressing :kbd:`Shift-F`
   in the 3D View and then moving the brush and then :kbd:`LMB`.
   You can enter the size numerically also while in :kbd:`Shift-F` sizing.
   Brush strength can be affected by enabling the pressure sensitivity icon,
   if a supported tablet is being used.

   .. tip::

      If the range of strengths does not seem to fit the model (for example,
      if even the lowest strength setting still makes too large of a change on the model)
      then you can scale the model (in *Edit Mode*, not *Object Mode*).
      Larger sizes will make the brush's effect smaller, and vice versa.

Autosmooth
   Sets the amount of smoothing to be applied to each stroke.
Normal Weight :kbd:`Ctrl`
   Constrains brush movement along the surface normal.
   Especially useful with the *Grab Brush*, can be temporarily enabled by holding :kbd:`Ctrl`.
   e.g. Grab brush can be used to push a depression (hole) into the mesh when *Normal Weight* is set.

   Applies to *Grab* and *Snake Hook* brushes.
Sculpt Plane
   Use this menu to set the plane in which the sculpting takes place.
Front Faces Only
   When enabled, the brush only affects vertices that are facing the viewer.
Add/Subtract :kbd:`Ctrl`
   Brush direction toggle. :kbd:`Ctrl` pressed while sculpting.
Accumulate
   Causes stroke dabs to accumulate on top of each other.


Texture Panel
=============

Texture
   Texture to be used to determine the strength of brush.
Brush Mapping
   Sets the way the texture is mapped to the brush stroke:

   Fixed
      If *Fixed* is enabled, the texture follows the mouse,
      so it appears that the texture is being dragged across the model.
   Tiled
      The *Tile* option tiles the texture across the screen,
      so moving the brush appears to move separately from the texture.
      The *Tile* option is most useful with tileable images, rather than procedural textures.
   3D
      The *3D* option allows the brush to take full advantage of procedural textures.
      This mode uses vertex coordinates rather than the brush location to determine what area of the texture to use.
Angle
   This is the rotation angle of the texture brush.
   It can be changed interactively via :kbd:`Ctrl-F` in the 3D View.
   While in the interactive rotation you can enter a value numerically as well. Can be set to:

   User
      Directly input the angle value.
   Rake :kbd:`R`
      Angle follows the direction of the brush stroke. Not available with *3D* textures.
   Random :kbd:`R`
      Angle is randomized.
   Random Angle
      ToDo.
Offset
   Fine tunes the texture map placement in the x, y, and z axes.
Size
   This setting allows you to modify the scaling factor of the texture. Not available for *Drag* textures.
Sample Bias
   Value added to texture samples.


Stroke Panel
============

Stroke Method :kbd:`E`
   Defines the way brush strokes are applied to the mesh:

   Dots
      Standard brush stroke.
   Drag Dot
      Creates a single displacement in the brush shape. Click then drag on mesh to desired location, then release.
   Space
      Creates brush stroke as a series of dots, whose spacing is determined by the *Spacing* setting.
      *Spacing* represents the percentage of the brush diameter.
   Anchored
      Creates a single displacement at the brush location.
      Clicking and dragging will resize the brush diameter.
      When *Edge to Edge* the brush location and orientation is determined by a two point circle,
      where the first click is one point, and dragging places the second point, opposite from the first.
   Airbrush
      Flow of the brush continues as long as the mouse click is held, determined by the *Rate* setting.
      If disabled, the brush only modifies the model when the brush changes its location.
      This option is not available for the *Grab* brush.

The following parameters are available for the *Dots*, *Space*,
and *Airbrush* strokes:

Jitter
   Jitters the position of the brush while painting.
Smooth Stroke :kbd:`Shift-S`
   Brush lags behind mouse and follows a smoother path. When enabled, the following become active:

   Radius
      Sets the minimum distance from the last point before stroke continues.
   Factor
      Sets the amount of smoothing.


Curve Panel
===========

The *Curve* section allows you to use a curve control to the right to modify the
intensity of the brush from its center (left part of the curve) towards its borders
(right part of the curve).

   Read more about using the :ref:`ui-curve-widget`.


Symmetry Panel
==============

Mirror
  Mirror the brush strokes across the selected local axes.
  Note that if you want to alter the directions the axes point in,
  you must rotate the model in *Edit Mode*, not *Object Mode*
Radial
   These settings allow for radial symmetry in the desired axes.
   The number determines how many times the stroke will be repeated within 360 degrees around the central axes.
Feather
   Reduces the strength of the stroke where it overlaps the planes of symmetry.
Lock
   These three buttons allow you to block any modification/deformation
   of your model along selected local axes, while you are sculpting it.
Tiling
   Using this option allows you to seamlessly tile your strokes along the given
   axes.
Tile Offset
   The default tile size is set to one :abbr:`BU (Blender Unit)`. The offset allows the
   option to alter the tile size along all three axes.
