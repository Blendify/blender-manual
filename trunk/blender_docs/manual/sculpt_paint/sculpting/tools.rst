   Sculpt brushes.

Blob
   Pushes mesh outward or inward into a spherical shape with settings to
   control the amount of pinching at the edge of the sphere.
Clay :kbd:`C`
   Similar to the *Draw* brush, but includes settings to adjust the plane on which the brush acts.
Clay Strips
   Similar to the *Clay* brush, but it uses a cube test to define the brush area of influence rather than a sphere.
Crease :kbd:`Shift-C`
   Creates sharp indents or ridges by pushing or pulling the mesh, while pinching the vertices together.
Fill/Deepen
   Works like the Flatten brush, but only brings vertices below the brush plane upwards.
   The inverse of the Scrape brush is to *Deepen* by pushing vertices above the plane downward.
Flatten/Contrast :kbd:`Shift-T`
   The *Flatten* brush pulls the vertices towards the *Sculpt plane*.
   The inverse of the Flatten brush is the *Contrast*
   brush which pushes vertices up or down away from the *Sculpt Plane*.
Grab :kbd:`G`
   Used to drag a group of points around. Unlike the other brushes,
   *Grab* does not modify different points as the brush is dragged across the model.
   Instead, *Grab* selects a group of vertices on mouse-down, and pulls them to follow the mouse.
   The effect is similar to moving a group of vertices in *Edit Mode* with proportional-editing enabled,
   except that *Grab* can make use of other Sculpt Mode options (like textures and symmetry).
Inflate/Deflate :kbd:`I`
   Similar to *Draw*, except that vertices in *Inflate* mode are displaced in the direction of their own normals.
Layer :kbd:`L`
   This brush is similar to *Draw*, except that the height of the displacement layer is capped.
   This creates the appearance of a solid layer being drawn.
   This brush does not draw on top of itself; a brush stroke intersects itself.
   Releasing the mouse button and starting a new stroke
   will reset the depth and paint on top of the previous stroke.

   Persistent
      ToDo <2.70.
   Set Persistent Base
      ToDo <2.70.
Mask :kbd:`M`
   Lets you select mesh parts to be unaffected by other brushes by painting vertex colors.
   The mask values are shown as grayscale.
   I.e the darker a masked area is, the less effect sculpting on it will have.
   See also the options of the :ref:`sculpt-mask-menu` menu.

   Mask Tool
      The mask brush has two modes:

      Draw
         Mask drawing.
      Smooth :kbd:`Shift`
         Pressing :kbd:`Shift` with the mask brush active will toggle the mask smoothing mode.
Nudge
   Moves vertices in the direction of the brush stroke.
Pinch/Magnify :kbd:`P`
   Pulls vertices towards the center of the brush.
   The inverse setting is *Magnify*, in which vertices are pushed away from the center of the brush.
Rotate
   Rotates vertices within the brush in the direction the cursor is moved. The initial drag direction
   is the zero angle and by rotating around the center you can create a vortex effect.
Scrape/Peaks
   The *Scrape* brush works like the Flatten brush, but only brings vertices above the plane downwards.
   The inverse of the Scrape brush is to *Peak* by pushing vertices above the plane up away from the plane.
SculptDraw :kbd:`X`
   Moves vertices inward or outward,
   based the average normal of the vertices contained within the drawn brush stroke.
Smooth :kbd:`S`
   As the name suggests,
   eliminates irregularities in the area of the mesh within the brush's
   influence by smoothing the positions of the vertices.
Snake Hook :kbd:`K`
   Pulls vertices along with the movement of the brush to create long, snake-like forms.

   Pinch
      Snake-hook tended to loose volume along the stroke,
      with pinch > 0.5 its possible to sculpt shapes without loosing volume
   Rake
      A factor to support grabbing the mesh with rotation following the cursors motion.
Thumb
   Similar to the *Nudge* brush, this one flattens the mesh in the brush area,
   while moving it in the direction of the brush stroke.
Simplify
   This brush collapses short edges (as defined by the detail size) whether or
   not the *Collapse Short Edges* option is enabled.
   This brush has no effect if dynamic topology is not enabled.
   It can be found in the :menuselection:`Brush --> Sculpt Tool` menu.


Common Options
--------------

Radius
   This option controls the radius of the brush, measured in pixels.
   :kbd:`F` allows you to change the brush size interactively by
   dragging the mouse and then :kbd:`LMB` (the texture of the brush should be visible inside the circle).
   Typing a number then enter while using :kbd:`F` allows you to enter the size numerically.
   Brush size can be affected by enabling the pressure sensitivity icon,
   if you are using a :ref:`Graphics Tablet <hardware-tablet>`.
Strength
   Controls how much each application of the brush affects the model.
   For example, higher values cause the *Draw* brush to add depth to the model more quickly,
   and cause the *Smooth* brush to smooth the model more quickly.
   This setting is not available for *Grab*, *Snake Hook*, or *Rotate*.

   You can change the brush strength interactively by pressing :kbd:`Shift-F`
   in the 3D View and then moving the brush and then :kbd:`LMB`.
   You can enter the size numerically also while in :kbd:`Shift-F` sizing.
   Brush strength can be affected by enabling the pressure sensitivity icon,
   if a supported tablet is being used.

   .. tip::

      If the range of strengths does not seem to fit the model (for example,
      if even the lowest strength setting still makes too large of a change on the model)
      then you can scale the model (in *Edit Mode*, not *Object Mode*).
      Larger sizes will make the brush's effect smaller, and vice versa.

Autosmooth
   Sets the amount of smoothing to be applied to each stroke.
Normal Weight :kbd:`Ctrl`
   Constrains brush movement along the surface normal.
   Especially useful with the *Grab Brush*, can be temporarily enabled by holding :kbd:`Ctrl`.
   e.g. Grab brush can be used to push a depression (hole) into the mesh when *Normal Weight* is set.

   Applies to *Grab* and *Snake Hook* brushes.
Use Original Normal (padlock icon)
   ToDo.
Sculpt Plane
   Use this menu to set the plane in which the sculpting takes place.

   Area Plane
      The plane is located at the average height above/below the vertices within the brush area.
      Essentially, this means that the direction is dependent on the surface beneath the brush.

      .. (alt) The vertices are pushed towards the plane defined by vertices towards the edge of the brush.
   View Plane
      ToDo 2.64.
   X, Y, Z Plane
      Global.

      ToDo 2.64.
Plane Offset
   ToDo 2.64.
Trim
   ToDo 2.64.
Front Faces Only
   When enabled, the brush only affects vertices that are facing the viewer.
Add/Subtract :kbd:`Ctrl`
   Brush direction toggle. :kbd:`Ctrl` pressed while sculpting.
Accumulate
   Causes stroke dabs to accumulate on top of each other.


Symmetry/Lock Panel
===================

   | Mode:     Sculpt Mode
   | Panel:    :menuselection:`Tool Shelf --> Tools --> Symmetry/Lock`
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Sculpt --> Symmetry/Lock`

Mirror
  Mirror the brush strokes across the selected local axes.
  Note that if you want to alter the directions the axes point in,
  you must rotate the model in *Edit Mode*, not *Object Mode*
Radial
   These settings allow for radial symmetry in the desired axes.
   The number determines how many times the stroke will be repeated within 360 degrees around the central axes.
Feather
   Reduces the strength of the stroke where it overlaps the planes of symmetry.
Lock
   These three buttons allow you to block any modification/deformation
   of your model along selected local axes, while you are sculpting it.
Tiling
   Using this option allows you to seamlessly tile your strokes along the given
   axes. This allows to create repeating patterns.
Tile Offset
   The default tile size is set to one :abbr:`BU (Blender Unit)`. The offset allows the
   option to alter the tile size along all three axes.
