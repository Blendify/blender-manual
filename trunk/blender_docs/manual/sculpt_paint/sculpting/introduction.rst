Overview
========

*Sculpt Mode* is similar to *Edit Mode* in that it is used to alter the shape of a model,
but Sculpt Mode uses a very different workflow:
instead of dealing with individual elements (vertices, edges, and faces),
an area of the model is altered using a brush.
In other words, instead of selecting a group of vertices,
Sculpt Mode automatically selects vertices based on where the brush is, and modifies them accordingly.


Sculpt Mode
===========

Sculpt mode is selected from the mode menu of the *3D View* header.
Once sculpt mode is activated, the Tool Shelf of the *3D View* will change
to sculpt mode specific panels. The panels will be *Brush*,
*Texture*, *Tool*, *Symmetry*, *Stroke*, *Curve*, *Appearance*, and *Options*.
A red circle will appear and follow the location of the cursor in the 3D View.

.. note::

   To have a predictable brush behavior, apply the scale of your mesh.
