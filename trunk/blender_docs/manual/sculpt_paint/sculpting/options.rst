=============

Gravity
   Factor
      Setting the factor allows you to add gravity to your brush strokes,
      giving it a draping effect.
   Orientation
      Using another object, the gravity can be oriented to the set object's local
      Z axis, changing the direction of the gravity.
Threaded Sculpt
   Takes advantage of multiple CPU processors to improve sculpting performance.
Fast Navigation
   For *multi-resolution* models, shows low resolution while navigating in the viewport.
Use Deform Only
   Limits the activated modifiers on the active object to Deform Modifiers, and Multiresolution.
   Constructive modifiers (like Subdivision Surface, Mirror and other) get deactivated,
   because they could give inaccurate results.
Show Diffuse Color
   Allows the active object to show its diffuse color when sculpting.
Show Mask
   The option to hide mask in the viewport.
   Brushes themselves are still affected by the mask, but the viewport will not display the mask.
Unified Settings
   Size
      Forces the brush size to be shared across brushes.
   Strength
      Forces the brush strength to be shared across brushes.
   Color
      Not used in Sculpt Mode.
