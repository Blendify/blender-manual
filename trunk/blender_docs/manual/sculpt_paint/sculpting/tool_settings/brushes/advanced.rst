Sculpt Plane
   Use this menu to set the plane in which the sculpting takes place.
   In other words, the primary direction that the vertices will move.

   Area Plane
      The movement takes place in the direction of average normal for all active vertices within the brush area.
      Essentially, this means that the direction is dependent on the surface beneath the brush.
   View Plane
      Sculpting in the plane of the current 3D View.
   X, Y, Z Plane
      The movement takes place in the positive direction of one of the global axes.

Original Normal
   When locked it keeps using the normal of the surface where stroke was initiated,
   instead of the surface normal currently under the cursor.


Accumulate
   Causes stroke dabs to accumulate on top of each other.
Front Faces Only
   When enabled, the brush only affects vertices that are facing the viewer.

2D Falloff
   This turns the brush influence into a cylinder (the depth along the view is ignored) instead of a sphere.
   It can be used along the outline of a mesh to adjust its silhouette.
