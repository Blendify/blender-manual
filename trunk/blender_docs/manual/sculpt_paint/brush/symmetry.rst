Mirror
   Mirror the brush strokes across the selected local axes.
   Note that if you want to alter the directions the axes point in,
   you must rotate the model in Edit Mode and not in Object Mode.
Radial
   These settings allow for radial symmetry in the desired axes.
   The number determines how many times the stroke will be repeated
   within 360 degrees around the central axes.

   Not available in Texture Painting.
