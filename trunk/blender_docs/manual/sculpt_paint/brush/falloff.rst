Falloff
*******

The Falloff allows you to control the *Strength* falloff of the brush.
The falloff is mapped from the center of the brush (left part of the curve)
towards its borders (right part of the curve).
Changing the shape of the curve will make the brush softer or harder.

   Brush curve example.

Curve Preset
   Todo.

   Smoother
      Similar to *Smooth* but produces a flat surface at the brush center.

Falloff Shape
   Sphere
      Applies brushes influence in a sphere, outwards from the center.
   Projected
      This turns the brush influence into a cylinder (the depth along the view is ignored) instead of a sphere.
      It can be used along the outline of a mesh to adjust its silhouette.


Normal Falloff
==============

As faces point away from the view the brush strokes fade away to prevent harsh edges.

Angle
   The angle at which the falloff begins.
