Weight paint tools:

Draw
   TODO.
Blur
   Smooths out the weighting of adjacent vertices. In this mode the Weight
   Value is ignored. The strength defines how much the smoothing is applied.
Average
   TODO.
Smear
   TODO.
Gradient
   Applies a linear/radial weight gradient;
   this is useful at times when painting gradual changes in weight becomes difficult.
   Blends the weights of selected vertices with unselected vertices.

      Example of the Gradient tool being used with selected vertices.

   Weight
      The gradient starts at the current selected weight value, blending out to nothing.
   Strength
      Lower values can be used so the gradient mixes in with the existing weights (just like with the brush).
   Type
      - Linear: :kbd:`Alt-LMB` and drag.
      - Radial: :kbd:`Ctrl-Alt-LMB` and drag.
Sample Wights
   TODO.
