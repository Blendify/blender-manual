   Brush panel.

Painting needs paint brushes and Blender provides a Brush Panel within the Toolbar
when it operates in *Weight Paint Mode*.

Brush
   In the :ref:`Data-Block menu <ui-data-block>` you find predefined Brush Presets.
   And you can create your own custom presets as needed.
Weight :kbd:`W`
   The weight (color) to be used by the brush.
   However, the weight value is applied to the Vertex Group
   in different ways depending on the selected Brush Blending mode (see below).

   Use :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` to sample the weight value of clicked vertex.
   :kbd:`Shift-LMB` lets you select the group from which to sample from.
Radius
   The radius defines the area of influence of the brush.
Strength
   This is the amount of paint to be applied per brush stroke.
   What that means exactly also depends on the Brush Blending mode.


Advanced
--------

Accumulate
   This will allow a stroke to accumulate on itself, just like an airbrush would do.
Front Faces Only
   Only paint on the front side of faces.

2D Falloff
   This turns the brush influence into a cylinder (the depth along the view is ignored)
   instead of a sphere.
