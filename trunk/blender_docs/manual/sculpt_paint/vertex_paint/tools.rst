The *Tool Shelf* contains most of the options for vertex painting.
The following sections describe the controls in each of the available panels.

   Vertex Painting options.


Brush
=====

Brush
   The :doc:`brush presets </sculpt_paint/brush/brush>` data-block menu.
Color
   The color of the brush. See :ref:`ui-color-picker`.

   Press :kbd:`S` on any part of the image to sample that color and set it as
   the brush color.

   Flip (cycle icon) :kbd:`X`
      Swaps the foreground and background color.

   .. note::

      Note that Vertex Paint works in sRGB :term:`space <Color Space>`, and the
      RGB representation of the same colors will be different between the paint
      tools and the materials that are in linear space.

Radius
   Set the radius of the brush.
Strength
   Set the strength of the brush's effect.
Blend
   See :term:`Color Blend Modes`.

Options
   Accumulate
      This will allow a stroke to accumulate on itself, just like an airbrush would do.
   Affect Alpha
      When this is disabled, it locks (prevents changes) the alpha channel while painting.
   Front Faces Only
      Only paint on the front side of faces.
   2D Falloff
      This turns the brush influence into a cylinder (the depth along the view is ignored) instead of a sphere.

Texture
=======

See :doc:`/sculpt_paint/brush/texture`.


Stroke & Curve
==============

See :doc:`/sculpt_paint/brush/stroke`.


Symmetry
========

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Vertex Paint Mode
   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Tool Shelf --> Tool --> Symmetry`
   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Properties --> Tool --> Symmetry`
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Sculpt --> Symmetry`

Mirror
   Mirror the brush strokes across the selected local axes.
   Note that if you want to alter the directions the axes point in,
   you must rotate the model in Edit Mode and not in Object Mode.
Radial
   These settings allow for radial symmetry in the desired axes.
   The number determines how many times the stroke will be repeated within 360 degrees around the central axes.


Paint Tools
===========

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Vertex Paint Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Paint`

Set Vertex Colors :kbd:`Shift-K`
   Fill the active vertex color layer with the current paint color.
Smooth Vertex Colors
   Smooth colors across vertices.
Dirty Vertex Colors
   Blur Strength
      Blur strength per iteration.
   Blur Iterations
      Number of times to blur the colors (higher blurs more).
   Highlight Angle
      Less than 90 limits the angle used in the tonal range.
   Dirt Angle
      Less than 90 limits the angle used in the tonal range.
   Dirt Only
      When active it won't calculate cleans for convex areas.
Vertex Color from Weight
   Converts the active weight into grayscale vertex colors.
Invert
   Invert RGB values.
Levels
   Adjust levels of vertex colors.
Hue Saturation Value
   Adjust vertex color HSV values.
Bright/Contrast
   Adjust vertex color brightness/contrast.
