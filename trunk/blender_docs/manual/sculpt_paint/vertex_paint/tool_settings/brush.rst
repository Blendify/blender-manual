   Vertex Painting options.

Brush
   The :doc:`brush presets </sculpt_paint/brush/brush>` data-block menu.
Color
   The color of the brush. See :ref:`ui-color-picker`.

   Press :kbd:`S` on any part of the image to sample that color and set it as the brush color.
   Hold :kbd:`Ctrl` while painting to temporally paint with the secondary color.

   Flip (cycle icon) :kbd:`X`
      Swaps the primary and secondary colors.

   .. note::

      Note that Vertex Paint works in sRGB :term:`space <Color Space>`, and
      the RGB representation of the same colors will be different between the paint
      tools and the materials that are in linear space.

Radius
   Set the radius of the brush.
Strength
   Set the strength of the brush's effect.
Blend
   See :term:`Color Blend Modes`.


Options
=======

Accumulate
   This will allow a stroke to accumulate on itself, just like an airbrush would do.
Affect Alpha
   When this is disabled, it locks (prevents changes) the alpha channel while painting.
Front Faces Only
   Only paint on the front side of faces.
2D Falloff
   This turns the brush influence into a cylinder (the depth along the view is ignored) instead of a sphere.
