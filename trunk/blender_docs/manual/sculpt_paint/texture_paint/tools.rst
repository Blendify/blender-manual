Texture Paint Tools
*******************

Draw
   The normal brush, paints a swath of color.

   Use Gradient
      A gradient can be used as a color source.

      Gradient Colors
         The :ref:`ui-color-ramp-widget` to define the gradient colors.
      Mode
         Pressure
            Will choose a color from the color ramp according to the stylus pressure.
         Clamp
            Will alter the color along the stroke and as specified by *Gradient spacing*.
            With Clamp it uses the last color of the color ramp after the specified gradient.
         Repeat
            Similar to *Clamp*. After the last color it resets the color to the first color in the color ramp and
            repeats the pattern.

Soften
   Uses a "blur effect" to soften or sharpen the image.

   Direction
      Soften
         Is used to paint a blur effect.

         Kernel Radius (2D only)
            Blur radius in pixels.
      Sharpen
         The Sharpen tool enhances the contrast of the image as you paint over it.

         Sharp Threshold
            The Threshold will only apply sharpening to only those pixels that
            differ more than the threshold value from their surrounding pixels.
         Kernel Radius (2D only)
            The kernel size controls how big an area the tool searches over is while calculating that difference.
   Blur Mode
      The blur kernel type controls how neighboring pixels are weighted when calculating the blur effect.

      Gaussian
         Gaussian will sample the pixels near the center of the brush most.
      Box
         Box samples all surrounding pixels equally.

Smear
   When you click, takes the colors under the cursor, and blends them in the direction you move the mouse.
   Similar to the "smudge" tool of *Gimp*.

Clone
   Copies the colors from the specified image (or location of the same image) to the active image.

   In 3D projective painting the clone cursor can be set with :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB`.
   In 2D painting the clone can be moved dragging it with :kbd:`RMB`.

   Clone from Paint Slot (3D projective only)
      Use another image as clone source, instead of using the 3D cursor position as the source in the same image.

      Source Clone Slot
         This allows you to select an image as a clone source.

   Image (2D only)
      Image used as a clone source.
   Alpha (2D only)
      Opacity of the clone image display.

Fill
   It can be used to fill large areas of the image with the brush color.
   The tool fills adjacent pixels that have a color value similar to the pixel you clicked on.

   Fill Threshold (2D only)
      Determines how much the color must be similar to the color of pixel you click to be filled.
      A low *Threshold* only fills very similar in color pixels.
      A higher *Threshold* fills pixels within a broader range of color.

   Use Gradient
      Allows the use of a gradient to fill the image.

      To apply the gradient with the *Fill* brush click :kbd:`LMB` and drag to define
      the gradient line, or radius if a radial gradient is used (depending on the *Gradient Fill Mode*).

      Gradient Colors
         The :ref:`ui-color-ramp-widget` to define the gradient colors.

      Gradient Fill Mode
         Linear, Radial

   .. note:: Overrides

      For projective texturing it will bypass some options for projective painting to paint the model.
      This means that occluded, backfacing and normal culled faces will always get filled,
      regardless of whether the options are activated
      in the :doc:`External </sculpt_paint/texture_paint/tool_settings/options>` panel.

Mask
   The mask feature maps an image to the mesh and uses the image intensity to
   mask out certain parts of the mesh out during painting.
   The mask options can be found in the :doc:`Mask panel </sculpt_paint/texture_paint/tool_settings/mask>`.
   It's only available for 3D projective painting.

   Mask Value
      Mask weight, a value of zero means not masked, while one is completely masked.

   .. tip::

      Use the face selection mask to isolate faces.
      See :ref:`Face Selection Masking <bpy.types.Mesh.use_paint_mask>` for details.
