   Texture Slots settings.

The combination of images associated with UV maps is called "slots".

Selecting a *Paint Slots* or *Canvas Image*
will also display the corresponding image in the Image Editor.

Painting Mode
   The slot system includes two painting modes:

   Single Image
      You can just select an existing image and painting will use
      the active UV layer for painting.

      Image
         Allows you to select the image used as a canvas.

         New
            Create a new image.
      UV Map
         Allows you to select the UV layer for painting.
         (Same as the currently active UV map in the mesh's *UV Maps* panel.)
      Texture Filter Type
         Set the interpolation mode of the texture. This can be Linear or Closest.

   Material
      This mode tries to detect the slots from the materials of the mesh.

      For the Cycles renderer, all textures (*Image Texture* node) on the material's node tree
      are added on the slots tab.

      Available Paint Slots
         A :ref:`List view <ui-list-view>` of slots.
         To activate a certain slot to use it for paint a just :kbd:`LMB` click on it.

Save All Images
   Repack (or save if external file) all edited images.
   Same as in the :doc:`Image Editor </editors/image/introduction>`.
