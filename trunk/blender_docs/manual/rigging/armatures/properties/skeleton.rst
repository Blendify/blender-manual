   The Skeleton panel.

In this panel you can arrange sets of bones into different layers for easier manipulation.


Position
========

A radio button to switch between Pose Position and Rest Position.

Whereas in *Edit Mode*, you always see your armature in its rest position,
in *Object Mode* and *Pose Mode* you see it by default in its *Pose Position*
(i.e. as it was transformed in the *Pose Mode*).
If you want to see it in the rest position in all modes,
enable the *Rest Position* button in the *Armature* tab (*Edit Mode*).


.. _armature-layers:

Armature Layers
===============

Each armature has 32 "Armature layers" which allow you to organize your armature by
"regrouping" sets of bones into layers; this works similar to scene layers
(those containing your objects). You can then "move" a bone to a given layer,
hide or show one or several layers, etc.


Showing/Hiding Bone Layers
--------------------------

Only bones in active layers will be visible/editable, but they will always be effective
(i.e move objects or deform geometry), whether in an active layer or not. To
(de)activate a layer, you have several options, depending in which mode you are in:

- In all modes, use the row of small buttons at the top of the *Display Options* group, *Armature* panel.
  If you want to enable/disable several layers at once, as usual, hold :kbd:`Shift` while clicking...
- In *Edit Mode* and *Pose Mode*, you can also do this from the *3D View*,
  either by using the menu :menuselection:`Armature --> Switch Armature Layers` or
  :menuselection:`Pose --> Switch Armature Layers`, or the :kbd:`Shift-M` shortcut,
  to display a small pop-up menu containing the same buttons as described above
  (here again, you can use :kbd:`Shift-LMB` clicks to (de)select several layers at once).


Protected Layers
----------------

You can lock a given bone layer for all :ref:`proxies <object-proxy>`
of your armature, i.e. all bones in this layer will not be editable.
To do so, in the *Skeleton* panel, :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` click on the relevant button, the layer lock will be enabled.

Protected layers in proxy are restored to proxy settings on file reload and undo.
