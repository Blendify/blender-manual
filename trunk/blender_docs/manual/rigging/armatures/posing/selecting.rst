Selecting
*********

Selection in *Pose Mode* is very similar to the one in :doc:`Edit Mode </rigging/armatures/bones/selecting>`,
with a few specificities:

You can only select *whole bones* in *Pose Mode*, not roots/tips...


Grouped
=======

You can select bones based on their group and/or layer, through the *Select Grouped* pop-up menu :kbd:`Shift-G`:

- To select all bones belonging to the same group(s) as the selected ones,
  use the *In Same Group* entry :kbd:`Shift-G-Numpad1`.
- To select all bones belonging to the same layer(s) as the selected ones,
  use the *In Same Layer* entry :kbd:`Shift-G-Numpad2`.
