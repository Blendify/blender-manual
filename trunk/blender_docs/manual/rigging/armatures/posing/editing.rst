   Pose Tools.

In *Pose Mode*, bones behave like objects. So the transform actions
(grab/rotate/scale, etc.) are very similar to the same ones in *Object* mode
(all available ones are regrouped in the :menuselection:`Pose --> Transform` sub-menu). However,
there are some important specificities:

- Bones' relationships are crucial (see :ref:`bone-relations-parenting`).
- The "transform center" of a given bone
  (i.e. its default pivot point, when it is the only selected one) is *its root*.
  Note by the way that some pivot point options seem to not work properly, In fact,
  except for the *3D Cursor* one, all others appear to always use the median point of the selection
  (and not e.g. the active bone's root when *Active Object* is selected, etc.).


Basic Posing
============

As previously noted,
bones' transformations are performed based on the *Rest Position* of the armature,
which is its state as defined in *Edit Mode*. This means that in rest position,
in *Pose Mode*, each bone has a scale of 1.0, and null rotation and position
(as you can see it in the *Transform* panel, in the 3D Views).

.. figure:: /images/rigging_armatures_posing_editing_local-rotation.png

   An example of locally-Y-axis locked rotation, with two bones selected.

   Note that the two green lines materializing the axes are centered on the armature's center,
   and not each bone's root...

Moreover, the local space for these actions is the bone's own one
(visible when you enable the *Axes* option of the *Armature* panel).
This is especially important when using axis locking, for example,
there is no specific "bone roll" tool in *Pose Mode*,
as you can rotate around the bone's main axis just by locking on the local Y axis
:kbd:`R-Y-Y`... This also works with several bones selected;
each one is locked to its own local axis!

When you pose your armature,
you are supposed to have one or more objects skinned on it! And obviously,
when you transform a bone in *Pose Mode*,
its related objects or object's shape is moved/deformed accordingly, in real time.
Unfortunately, if you have a complex rig set-up and/or a heavy skin object,
this might produce lag, and make interactive editing very painful.
If you experience such troubles, try enabling the *Delay Deform* button of
the *Armature* panel the skin objects will only be updated once you validate
the transform operation.


Auto IK
=======

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Pose Mode
   | Panel:    :menuselection:`Tool Shelf --> Options --> Pose Options`

The auto IK option in the Tool Shelf enables a temporary IK constraint when posing bones.
The chain acts from the tip of the selected bone to root of the uppermost parent bone.
Note that this mode lacks options,
and only works by applying the resulting transform to the bones in the chain.


Clear Transform
===============

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Pose Mode
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Pose --> Clear Transform`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`Alt-G`, :kbd:`Alt-R`, :kbd:`Alt-S`

Once you have transformed some bones, if you want to return to their rest position,
just clear their transformations.

Location, Rotation, Scale :kbd:`Alt-G`, :kbd:`Alt-R`, :kbd:`Alt-S`
   Clears individual transforms.
All
   To clear everything at once.
Reset Unkeyed
   Clears the transforms to their keyframe state.
   This operator is also available in the :menuselection:`Specials --> Clear User Transform` menu.

   Only Selected
      Operate on just the selected or all bones.

Note that in *Envelope* visualization, :kbd:`Alt-S` does not clear the scale,
but rather scales the *Distance* influence area of the selected bones
(also available through the :menuselection:`Pose --> Scale Envelope Distance` menu entry,
which is only effective in *Envelope* visualization, even though it is always available...).


Apply
=====

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Pose Mode
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Pose --> Apply`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`Ctrl-A`

Conversely, you may define the current pose as the new rest position
(i.e. "apply" current transformations to the *Edit Mode*),
using the :menuselection:`Pose --> Apply Pose as Restpose` menu entry
(or :kbd:`Ctrl-A` and confirm the pop-up menu). When you do so,
the skinned objects/geometry is **also** reset to its default, undeformed state,
which generally means you will have to skin it again.


In-Betweens
===========

There are several tools for editing poses in an animation.

There are also in *Pose Mode* a bunch of armature-specific editing options/tools,
like :ref:`auto-bones naming <armature-editing-naming-bones>`,
:ref:`properties switching/enabling/disabling <armature-bone-properties>`, etc.,
that we already described in the armature editing pages. See the links above...


Push Pose
---------

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Pose Mode
   | Panel:    :menuselection:`Tool Shelf --> Tool --> Tool --> Pose Tools --> In-Betweens: Push`
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Pose --> In-Betweens --> Push Pose`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`Ctrl-E`

Push pose exaggerates the current pose.


Relax Pose
----------

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Pose Mode
   | Panel:    :menuselection:`Tool Shelf --> Tool --> Pose Tools --> In-Betweens: Relax`
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Pose --> In-Betweens --> Relax Pose`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`Alt-E`

Relax pose is somewhat related to the above topic, but it is only useful with keyframed bones.
When you edit such a bone (and hence take it "away" from its "keyed position"),
using this tool will progressively "bring it back" to its "keyed position",
with smaller and smaller steps as it comes near it.


Breakdowner
-----------

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Pose Mode
   | Panel:    :menuselection:`Tool Shelf --> Tool --> Pose Tools --> In-Betweens: Breakdowner`
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Pose --> In-Betweens --> Pose Breakdowner`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`Shift-E`

Creates a suitable breakdown pose on the current frame.

The Breakdowner tool can be constrained to work on specific transforms and axes,
by pressing the following keys while the tool is active:

- :kbd:`G`, :kbd:`R`, :kbd:`S`: translate, rotate, scale
- :kbd:`B`: Bendy bones
- :kbd:`C`: custom properties
- :kbd:`X`, :kbd:`Y`, :kbd:`Z`: to the corresponding axes


Copy/Paste Pose
===============

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Pose Mode
   | Header:   Copy/Paste (|copy-paste|)
   | Panel:    :menuselection:`Tool Shelf --> Tool --> Pose Tools --> Pose: Copy, Paste`
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Pose --> Copy Current Pose`,
               :menuselection:`Pose --> Paste Pose`,
               :menuselection:`Pose --> Paste X-Flipped Pose`

Blender allows you to copy and paste a pose, either through the *Pose* menu, or
directly using the three "copy/paste" buttons found at the right part of the 3D Views header:

Copy Current Pose
   To copy the current pose of selected bones into the pose buffer.
Paste Pose
   Paste the buffered pose to the currently posed armature.
Paste X-Flipped Pose
   Paste the *X axis mirrored* buffered pose to the currently posed armature.

Here are important points:

- This tool works at the Blender session level, which means you can use it across armatures, scenes, and even files.
  However, the pose buffer is not saved, so you lose it when you close Blender.
- There is only one pose buffer.
- Only the selected bones are taken into account during copying (i.e. you copy only selected bones' pose).
- During pasting, on the other hand, bone selection has no importance.
  The copied pose is applied on a per-name basis
  (i.e. if you had a ``forearm`` bone selected when you copied the pose,
  the ``forearm`` bone of the current posed armature will get its pose when you paste it --
  and if there is no such named bone, nothing will happen...).
- What is copied and pasted is in fact the position/rotation/scale of each bone, in its own space.
  This means that the resulting pasted pose might be very different from the originally copied one, depending on:
  - The rest position of the bones,
  - and the current pose of their parents.

.. list-table::

   * - .. figure:: /images/rigging_armatures_posing_editing_copy-paste-pose-examples-1.png

Propagate
=========

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Pose Mode
   | Panel:    :menuselection:`Tool Shelf --> Tool --> Pose Tools --> Pose: Propagate`
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Pose --> Propagate`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`Alt-P`

The Propagate tool copies the pose of the selected bones on the current frame over
to the keyframes delimited by the *Termination Mode*.
It automates the process of copying and pasting.

ToDo 2.75.


Options
-------

Termination Mode
   Modes which determine how it decides when to stop overwriting keyframes.

   While Held
      The most complicated of the modes available, as it tries to guess when to stop propagating by
      examining the pauses in the animation curves per control
      (i.e. all F-Curves for a bone, instead of per F-Curve).
   To Next Keyframe
      Simply copies the pose to the first keyframe after (but not including any keyframe on) the current frame.
   To Last Keyframe
      Will simply replace the last keyframe. (i.e. making action cyclic).
   Before Frame
      To all keyframes between current frame and the *End frame* option.
      This option is best suited for use from scripts due to the difficulties in setting this frame value,
      though it is possible to set this manually via the Operator panel if necessary.
   Before Last Keyframe
      To all keyframes from current frame until no more are found.
   On Selected Keyframes
      Will apply the pose of the selected bones to all selected keyframes.
   On Selected Markers
      To all keyframes occurring on frames with Scene Markers after the current frame.
End Frame
   Defines the upper-bound for the frame range within which keyframes
   will be affected (with the lower bound being the current frame).


Show/Hide
=========

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     All Modes
   | Panel:    :menuselection:`Properties editor --> Bone --> Display`
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`... --> Show/Hide`

You do not have to use bone layers to show/hide some bones. As with objects,
vertices or control points, you can use :kbd:`H`:

- :kbd:`H` will hide the selected bone(s).
- :kbd:`Shift-H` will hide all bones *but the selected one(s)*.
- :kbd:`Alt-H` will show all hidden bones.

You can also use the *Hide* checkbox of the :menuselection:`Bone tab --> Display panel`.

Note that hidden bones are specific to a mode,
i.e. you can hide some bones in *Edit Mode*,
they will still be visible in *Pose Mode*, and vice versa.
Hidden bones in *Pose Mode* are also invisible in *Object Mode*.
And in *Edit Mode*, the bone to hide must be fully selected,
not just his root or tip.
