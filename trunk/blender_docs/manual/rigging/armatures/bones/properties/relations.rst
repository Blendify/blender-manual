Moving bones between layers
---------------------------

Obviously, you have to be in *Edit Mode* or *Pose Mode* to move bones between
layers. Note that as with objects, bones can lay in several layers at once,
just use the usual :kbd:`Shift-LMB` clicks... First of all,
you have to select the chosen bone(s)!

- In the Properties editor, use the "layer buttons" of each selected bone "sub-panel" (*Armature Bones* panel)
  to control in which layer(s) it lays.
- In the *3D View* editor, use the menu :menuselection:`Armature --> Move Bone To Layer` or
  :menuselection:`Pose --> Move Bone To Layer` or press :kbd:`M` to show the usual pop-up layers menu.
  Note that this way, you assign the same layers to all selected bones.
