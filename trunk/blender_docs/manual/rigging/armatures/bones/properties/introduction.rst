   | Mode:     Object Mode, Edit Mode and Pose Mode
   | Panel:    :menuselection:`Properties editor --> Bone`

When bones are selected (hence in *Edit Mode* and *Pose Mode*), their
properties are shown in the *Bone* tab of the Properties editor.
This shows different panels used to control features of each selected bone;
the panels change depending on which mode you are working in.

          The Transform panel (Pose Mode).

When in *Edit Mode* you can use this panel to control position and roll of individual bones.
Whereas in *Pose Mode* you can only set location for the main bone, and you can now set rotation and scale.
