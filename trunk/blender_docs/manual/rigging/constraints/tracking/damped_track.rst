Damped Track Constraint
***********************

The *Damped Track* constraint constrains one local axis of the owner to always point towards *Target*.
In other 3D software you can find it with the name "Look at" constraint.

   Damped Track panel.


Target (Mesh Object Type)
   This constraint uses one target, and is not functional (red state) when it has none.

   Vertex Group
      If *Target* is a *Mesh*,
      a new field is displayed offering the optional choice to set a *Vertex Group* as target.

Target (Armature Object Type):
   Bone
      If *Target* is an *Armature*,
      a new field is displayed offering the optional choice to set an individual bone as *Target*.
   Head/Tail
      If *Target* is an *Armature*,
      a new field is displayed offering the optional choice to set whether the Head or Tail of
      a Bone will be pointed at by the *Target*.
      It is a slider value field which can have a value between 0 and 1.
      A value of 0 will point the Target at the Head/Root of a Bone while a value of 1 will
      point the Target at the Tail/Tip of a Bone.

To
   Once the owner object has had a Damped Track constraint applied to it,
   you must then choose which axis of the object you want to point at the Target object.
   You can choose between 6 axis directions (-X, -Y, -Z, X, Y, Z).
   The negative axis direction cause the object to point away from the Target object along the
   selected axis direction.
