Target
   :ref:`ui-data-id` used to select the constraints target, and is not functional (red state) when it has none.
To
   Once the owner object has had a Damped Track constraint applied to it,
   you must then choose which axis of the object you want to point at the Target object.
   You can choose between 6 axis directions (-X, -Y, -Z, X, Y, Z).
   The negative axis direction cause the object to point away from the Target object along the
   selected axis direction.
