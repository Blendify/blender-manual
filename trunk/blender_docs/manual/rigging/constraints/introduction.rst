Constraints are a way to control an object's properties
(e.g. its location, rotation, scale), using either plain static values
(like the :doc:`"limit" ones </rigging/constraints/transform/limit_location>`),
or (an)other object, called "target"
(like e.g. the :doc:`"copy" ones </rigging/constraints/transform/copy_location>`).

Even though constraints are useful in static projects,
their main usage is obviously in animation.

- You can control an object's animation through the targets used by its constraints
  (this is a form of indirect animation). Indeed,
  these targets can then control the constraint's owner's properties, and hence,
  animating the targets will indirectly animate the owner.
- You can animate constraints' settings. e.g. the *Influence* or
  when using an armature's bone as target,
  animate where along this bone (between root and tip) lays the real target point.

They can make the eyes of a tennis player track a tennis ball bouncing across the court,
allow the wheels on a bus to all rotate together,
help a dinosaur's legs bend at the knee automatically, and
make it easy for a hand to grip the hilt of a sword and the sword to swing with the hand.

Constraints, in Blender, work with :term:`Objects <Object>` and :term:`Bones <Bone>`.
Read about using constraints in rigging
in the :doc:`Armature chapter </rigging/armatures/posing/bone_constraints/index>`.

Constraints work in combination with each other to form a Constraint Stack.

Tips
====

Constraints are a fantastic way to add sophistication and complexity to a rig.

But be careful not to rush in too quickly, piling up constraint upon constraint
until you lose all sense of how they interact with each other.

Start simply. Get to know a single constraint inside and out.
:doc:`/rigging/constraints/transform/copy_location` is a good first constraint to explore it
also has an animation example. Take the time to understand every fundamental concept behind it,
and the other constraints will make far more sense.

.. (TODO add), the 4x4 transform matrix vs. the transform panel

   Also note that constraints internally work using 4x4 transformation matrices only.
   When you use settings for specific rotation or scaling constraining,
   this information is being derived from the matrix only,
   not from settings in a *Bone* or *Object*. Especially for combining
   rotations with non-uniform or negative scaling this can lead to unpredictable behavior.
