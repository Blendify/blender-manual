***************************
Rigid Body Joint Constraint
***************************

The *Rigid Body Joint* constraint is very special,
it is used to simulate a joint between its owner and its target.
It offers four joint types: hinge type, ball-and-socket type, cone-twist type, and
generic six-\ :abbr:`DoF (Degrees of Freedom)` type.


.. TODO

   .. important::

      This constraint only works with the old Blender Game Engine,
      and might not doing anything in Blender 2.8.

The joint point and axes are defined and fixed relative to the owner.
The target moves as if it were stuck to the center point of a stick,
the other end of the stick rotating around the joint/pivot point...

For a demo file that shows some of the different types, see: `BGE-Physics-RigidBodyJoints.blend
<https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/File:BGE-Physics-RigidBodyJoints.blend>`__.

.. note::

   In order for this constraint to work properly, both objects
   (so the owner and the target object) need to have *Collision Bounds* enabled.

   Rigid Body Joint panel.

Target
   :ref:`ui-data-id` used to select the constraints target, and is not functional (red state) when it has none.

Joint Type
   Ball
      Works like an ideal ball-and-socket joint, i.e. allows rotations around all axes like a shoulder joint.
   Hinge
      Works in one plane, like an elbow: the owner and target can only rotate around the X axis of the pivot
      (joint point).

      Limits
         Angular limits for the X axis.
   Cone Twist
      Similar to *Ball*, this is a point-to-point joint with limits added for the cone and twist axis.

      Limits
         Angular limits.
   Generic 6DOF
      Works like the *Ball* option,
      but the target is no longer constrained at a fixed distance from the pivot point, by default
      (hence the six degrees of freedom: rotation and translation around/along the three axes).
      In fact, there is no longer a joint by default, with this option,
      but it enables additional settings which allow you to restrict some of these DoF:

      Limits
         Linear and angular limits for a given axis (of the pivot) in Blender Units and degrees respectively.

Child Object
   Normally, leave this blank. You can reset it to blank by right-clicking and selecting Reset to Default Value.

   .. Is this right? 2.4 just had a 'to object'. Now we have a 'target' and a 'child object'.
      These are not documented. It seems that we recreate the behavior of 2.4 by leaving the child object blank.
      The target seems to be the 2.4 'to object'. What is the child object? Please explain!

Linked Collision
   When enabled, this will disable the collision detection between the owner and the target.

Display Pivot
   When enabled, this will draw the pivot of the joint in the 3D Views.
   The most useful, especially with the *Generic 6DOF* joint type!

Pivot
   These three numeric fields allow you to relocate the pivot point, *in the owner's space*.
Axis
   These three numeric fields allow you to rotate the pivot point, *in the owner's space*.
