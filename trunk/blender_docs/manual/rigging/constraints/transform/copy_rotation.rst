   Copy Rotation panel.

Target
   :ref:`ui-data-id` used to select the constraints target, and is not functional (red state) when it has none.

X, Y, Z
   These buttons control which axes are constrained.

   Invert
      The *Invert* buttons invert their respective rotation values.

Offset
   When enabled, this control allows the owner to be rotated (using its current transform properties),
   relative to its target's orientation.

Space
