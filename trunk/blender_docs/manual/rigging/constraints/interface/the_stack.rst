*********************
The Constraints Stack
*********************

The combination of all the constraints that affect an object are called the Constraints Stack.
The Stack is in the Constraints panel, below the "Add Constraint" drop-down box.

Constraints in the stack are evaluated from top to bottom.
The order of each constraint has a substantial impace on the final outcome of the stack.
Changing the order of the constraints can change the behavior of the entire stack.

   The seven constraints in this example stack are evaluated from top to bottom starting with the "Action" constraint
   and ending with the final "Transformation" constraint.

To change the order of a constraint use the up/down arrows in the
:doc:`header </rigging/constraints/interface/header>`.
