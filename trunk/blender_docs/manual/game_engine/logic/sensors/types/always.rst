   Always sensor.


The *Always* sensor is used for things that need to be done every logic tick,
or at every *x* logic tick (with non-null *f*), or at start-up
(with *Tap*).

See :doc:`Sensor Common Options </game_engine/logic/sensors/common_options>` for common options.

This sensor doesn't have any special options.
