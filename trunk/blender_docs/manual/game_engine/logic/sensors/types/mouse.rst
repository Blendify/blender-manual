The controller consist only of a list of types of mouse events.
A ``FALSE`` pulse is given when any of these conditions ends.

Mouse over any
   Gives a ``TRUE`` pulse if the mouse moves over any game object.
Mouse over
   Gives a ``TRUE`` pulse if the mouse moves over the owner object.
Movement
   Any movement with the mouse causes a stream of ``TRUE`` pulses.
Wheel Down
   Causes a stream of ``TRUE`` pulses as the scroll wheel of the mouse moves down.

Right button

Middle button

   There is no logic brick for specific mouse movement and reactions
   (such as first person camera), these have to be coded in Python.
