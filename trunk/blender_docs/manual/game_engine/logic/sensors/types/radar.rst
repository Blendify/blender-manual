Radar Sensor
************

The *Radar Sensor* works much like the :doc:`Near sensor </game_engine/logic/sensors/types/near>`,
but only within an angle from an axis, forming an invisible cone with the top in the objects'
center and base at a distance on an axis.
This sensor is useful for giving bots sight only in front of them, for example.

.. note:: Note about soft bodies

   The *Radar* sensor cannot detect soft bodies.
   This is a limitation in Bullet, the physics library used by the Game Engine.

.. note::

   #. The Radar sensor can detect objects "through" other objects (walls etc).
   #. Objects must have "Actor" enabled to be detected.
