Sensors are the logic bricks that cause the logic to do anything.
Sensors give an output when something happens, e.g.
a trigger event such as a collision between two objects, a key pressed on the keyboard,
or a timer for a timed event going off. When a sensor is triggered,
a positive pulse is sent to all controllers that are linked to it.

The logic blocks for all types of sensor may be constructed and changed using the
:doc:`Logic Editor </editors/logic_editor>` details of this process are given in the
:doc:`Sensor Editing </game_engine/logic/sensors/editing>` page.
