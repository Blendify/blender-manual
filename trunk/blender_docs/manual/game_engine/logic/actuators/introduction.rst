Actuators perform actions, such as move, create objects, play a sound.
The actuators initiate their functions when they get a positive pulse from one (or more)
of their controllers.

The logic blocks for all types of actuator may be constructed and changed using
the :doc:`Logic Editor </editors/logic_editor>`; details of this process are given
in the :doc:`Actuator Editing </game_engine/logic/actuators/editing>` page.
