   Visibility actuator.


See :doc:`Actuator Common Options </game_engine/logic/actuators/common_options>` for common options.

Special Options:

Visible
   Toggle checkbox to toggle visibility
Occlusion
   Toggle checkbox to toggle occlusion. Must be initialized from the *Physics* tab.
Children
   Toggle checkbox to toggle recursive setting -
   will set visibility / occlusion state to all child objects, children of children (recursively)


Usage Notes
===========

Using the visiblity actuator will save on Rasterizer usage, however, not Physics,
and so is limited in terms of Level of Detail (LOD). For LOD look at replace mesh,
but be aware that the logic required can negate the effect of the LOD.
