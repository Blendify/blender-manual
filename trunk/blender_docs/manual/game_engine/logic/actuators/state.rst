State Actuator
**************

The State actuator allows the user to create complex logic,
whilst retaining a clear user interface. It does this by having different states,
and performing operations upon them

See :doc:`Actuator Common Options </game_engine/logic/actuators/common_options>` for common options.

Menu to select the state operation required.

   Change from the current state to the state specified.

Usage Notes
===========

With the state actuator, you can create tiers of logic,
without the need for hundreds of properties. Use it well, and you benefit greatly,
but often problems may be circumvented by python.
