*****************
Python Controller
*****************

The Python controller runs a Python script when a sensor triggers the controller.
This Python script can interact with the scene or logic bricks through
:doc:`Blender's API </game_engine/python_api/index>`.

A Python script can either run as an entire file or a single module.
A file must be added in the text editor, and is identified simply by its name, not its path.
Names are case sensitive. Modules are identified by the file name *without* the extension followed by a ``.``
and then the name of the module. For example:

A file ``myscript.py`` contains::

   def myModule ():
      print("Go Open Source!");


The function can be accessed as ``myscript.myModule``, which will run ``print("Go Open Source!");``
every time the controller is triggered.

The entire file can be run by setting the type to *Script* and setting the name to myscript.py.
