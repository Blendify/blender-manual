*********************
Expression Controller
*********************

This controller evaluates a user written expression, and gives a positive (TRUE) output when
The result of the expression is TRUE, and
The object is in the designated State.
For all other conditions the controller gives a negative (FALSE) output.

   Expression Controller.


Expression
==========

The expression, which is written in the box, can consist of variables,
constants and operators. These must follow the rules laid out below.


Variables
=========

You can use:

- *sensors names*,
- *properties* : assign a game property to an object and use it in a controller expression.

These cannot contain blank spaces.


Operations
==========

Mathematical operations
-----------------------

Operators: ``*``, ``/``, ``+``, ``-``

Returns: a number

Examples: ``3 + 2``, ``35 / 5``


Logical operations
------------------

- Comparison operators: ``<``, ``>``, ``>=``, ``<=``, ``==``, ``!=``
- Booleans operators: ``AND``, ``OR``, ``NOT``

Returns: ``True`` or ``False``.

Examples: ``3 > 2 (True)``, ``1 AND 0 (False)``


Conditional statement (if)
==========================

Use::

   if( expression, pulse_if_expression_is_true, pulse_if_expression_is_false )


If the controller evaluates ``expression`` to True:

- if ``pulse_if_expression_is_true`` is ``True``, the controller sends a positive pulse to the connected actuators.
- if ``pulse_if_expression_is_true`` is ``False``, the controller sends a negative pulse to the connected actuators.

If the controller evaluates ``expression`` to False:

- if ``pulse_if_expression_is_false`` is ``True``, the controller sends a positive pulse to the connected actuators.
- if ``pulse_if_expression_is_false`` is ``False``, the controller sends a negative pulse to the connected actuators.


Examples
========

Given the object has a property ``coins`` equal to 30::

   coins > 20

returns True (the controller sends a positive pulse to the connected actuators).


Given the object has:

- a sensor called ``Key_Inserted`` equal to True,
- a property named ``Fuel`` equal to False,

.. code-block:: python

   Key_Inserted AND Fuel


returns False (the controller sends a negative pulse to the connected actuators).

This is the same as doing::

   if (Key_Inserted AND Fuel, True, False)


Instead, you could do::

   if (Key_Inserted AND Fuel, False, True)


to return a positive pulse when ``Key_Inserted AND Fuel`` returns False.

You can also do::

   if ((Key_Inserted AND Fuel) OR (coins > 20), True, False)

This expression returns True,
hence in this case the controller sends a positive pulse to the connected actuators.
