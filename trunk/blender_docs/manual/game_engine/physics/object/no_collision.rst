********************************
No Collision Physics Object Type
********************************

"No Collision" objects in the :doc:`Game Engine </game_engine>` are completely unaffected by
:doc:`Physics </game_engine/physics>`, and do cause physics reactions.
They are useful as pure display objects, such as the child of a *Custom Collision Hull*
(:ref:`game_engine-physics-object-collision_bounds`).

In the example game demo, :doc:`Frijoles </ls/frijoles>`,
the No Collision type is represented by the "HUD" objects that display the health status.

For more documentation, see the :doc:`Top BGE Physics page </game_engine/physics>`.
