*****************
Standalone Player
*****************

The standalone player allows a Blender game to be run without having to load the Blender
system. This allows games to be distributed to other users,
without their requiring a detailed knowledge of Blender
(and also without the possibility of unauthorised modification). Note that the Game Engine
Save as Runtime is an add-on facility which must be pre-loaded before use.


The following procedure will give a standalone version of a working game.


- :menuselection:`File --> User Preferences --> Add-ons` :menuselection:`--> Game Engine --> Save As Game Engine Runtime` enable the checkbox. 
  (You can also :guilabel:`Save User Settings`, in which case the add-on will always be present whenever Blender is re-loaded).

- :menuselection:`File --> Export --> Save As Game Engine Runtime` 
  (give appropriate directory/filename) confirm with :guilabel:`Save as Game Engine Runtime`.

The game can then be executed by running the appropriate .exe file.
Note that all appropriate libraries are automatically loaded by the add-on.

If you are interested in licensing your game,
read `Licensing <https://www.blender.org/about/license/>`__
for a discussion of the issues involved.


.. tip:: Exporting...

   If the game is to be exported to other computers,
   make a new empty directory for the game runtime and all its ancilliary libraries etc.
   Then make sure the **whole directory** is transferred to the target computer
