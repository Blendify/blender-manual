Studio Lights

*Studio Lights* are used to light the 3D View,
mostly during *Solid view*. Lighting is constant and position "world" based.
There are four virtual light sources, used to illuminate 3D View scenes,
which will not display in renders.

The Lamp icons allow the user to enable or disable individual lights.
At least one of the four Lamps must remain enabled for the 3D View.
The lights are equal, except for their position and color.
You can control the direction of the lights, as well as their diffuse and specular colors.

      let us the user change the direction of the lamp by rotating the sphere.
