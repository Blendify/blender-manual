The colors for each editor can be set separately - simply select the editor you wish to
change in the multi-choice list at the left, and adjust colors as required.
Notice that changes appear in real-time on your screen. In addition, details such as the dot
size in the *3D View* or the *Graph Editor* can also be changed.

Themes use blender's preset system.
To save a theme, click the `+` button next to the preset selection drop-down and enter a name.
This will save the theme to an XML file in the ``./scripts/presets/interface_theme/`` subdirectory of one of the
:doc:`configuration directories </getting_started/installing_blender/directorylayout>`.
