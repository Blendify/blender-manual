The *Themes* tab allows you to customize interface appearance and colors.

The colors for each editor can be set separately by simply selecting the editor you wish to
change in the multi-choice list at the left, and adjusting colors as required.
Notice that changes appear in real-time on your screen. In addition, details such as the dot
size in the *3D View* or the *Graph Editor* can also be changed.

Themes use Blender's preset system to save a theme.
This will save the theme to an XML file in the ``./scripts/presets/interface_theme/`` subdirectory of one of the
:doc:`configuration directories </getting_started/installing/configuration/directories>`.

   Blender comes bundled with a small selection of themes.

   This is an example of the theme *Elsyiun*.
