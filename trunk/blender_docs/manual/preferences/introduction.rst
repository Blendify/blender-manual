This chapter explains how to change Blender's default configuration with the *User Preferences* editor.

The Blender *User Preferences* editor contains settings to control how Blender behaves.
At the top of the editor, the available options are grouped into tabs.


Open User Preferences
=====================

To open the *User Preferences* editor go to :menuselection:`File --> User Preferences`.

.. figure:: /images/preferences_interface_tab.png


Save User Settings
==================

Once you have set your preferences, you will need to manually save them,
otherwise the new configuration will be lost after a restart.

In the *User Preferences* editor, click on the *Save User Settings* button in the bottom left.
This will save all of the new preferences.

.. hint::

   It can be valuable to make a backup of your preferences in the event that you lose your configuration.

   See the :doc:`directory layout </getting_started/installing/configuration/directories>`
   section to see where your preferences are stored.


.. _factory-settings:

Load Factory Settings
=====================

Use this to restore the default configuration,
note that no permanent changes are made until you save the preferences.

Go to :menuselection:`File --> Load Factory Settings`
then optionally save the preferences via the *User Preferences* editor.
