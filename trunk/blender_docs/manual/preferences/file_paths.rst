Scripts Path
------------

By default Blender looks in several directories (OS dependent) for scripts.
By setting a user script path in the preferences an additional directory is looked in.
This can be used to store certain scripts/templates/presets independently of
the currently used Blender Version.

Inside the specified folder, specific subfolders have to be created to tell Blender what to look
for where. This folder structure has to mirror the structure of the scripts folder found in
the installation directory of Blender:

- scripts
- add-ons
- modules
- presets
- camera
- cloth
- interface_theme
- operator
- render
- ...
- startup
- templates
  Not all of the folders have to be present.

.. warning::

   Be sure that you have the right privileges for running the executable accessing the path defined.
   On MS-Windows for instance, if the option "Run this program as an administrator" is enabled for the executable,
   it will lead to a failure to open the editor due to a limitation within the OS User Account Control.
   Running a program with elevated privileges is potentially dangerous!


Render
======

Render Output

Render Cache
   The location where cached render images are stored.
