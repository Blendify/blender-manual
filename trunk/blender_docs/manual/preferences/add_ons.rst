Add-ons
*******

The Add-ons tab lets you manage secondary options which are not enabled in Blender by default.
New features may be added with *Install Add-ons*.
There will be a growing number of such Add-ons,
generated by the Blender-community so look out for that one feature you were missing
(or maybe simply create it yourself).

See the :doc:`Add-ons Page </advanced/scripting/python/add_ons>` for more on using Add-ons.
