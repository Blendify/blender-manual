   Color Balance Node

By default, the curve is a straight line, meaning there is no change.
The spectrum allows you to raise or lower HSV levels for each range of pixel colors.
To change a H, S, or V level, move the curve points up or down. Pixels with hue values each
point in the horizontal position of the graph will be changed depending on the shape of the
curve.
