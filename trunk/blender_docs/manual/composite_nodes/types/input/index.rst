  Composite Input Nodes
########################

Input nodes *produce* information from some source.

For instance, an input could be:

- taken directly from the active camera in a selected scene,
- from a JPG, PNG, etc. file as a static picture,
- a movie clip (such as an animation sequence or home movie), or
- just a color.

These nodes generate the information that feeds other nodes. As such,
they have no input-connectors; only outputs.
