Defocus
*******

This single node can be used to emulate depth of field using a postprocessing method.
It can also be used to blur the image in other ways,
not necessarily based on 'depth' by connecting something other than a Zbuffer. In essence,
this node blurs areas of an image based on the input zbuffer map/mask.


Camera Settings
===============

.. figure:: /images/Manual-Compositing-Node-Defocus_Camera_settings.jpg

   DofDist setting for the camera.


The *Defocus* node uses the actual camera data in your scene if supplied by a
*RenderLayer* node.

To set the point of focus, the camera now has a *Distance* parameter,
which is shorthand for Depth of Field Distance.
Use this camera parameter to set the focal plane of the camera
(objects Depth of Field Distance away from the camera are in focus).
Set *Distance* in the main *Camera* edit panel;
the button is right below the *Depth of Field*.

To make the focal point visible, enable the camera *Limits* option,
the focal point is then visible as a yellow cross along the view direction of the camera.


Node Inputs
===========

.. figure:: /images/Manual-Compositing-Node-Defocus.jpg

   Defocus node


The node requires two inputs, an image and a zbuffer,
the latter does not need to be an actual zbuffer, but can also be another (grayscale)
image used as mask, or a single value input, for instance from a time node,
to vary the effect over time.


Node Setting
============

The settings for this node are:

Bokeh Type menu
   Here you set the number of iris blades of the virtual camera's diaphragm.
   It can be set to emulate a perfect circle
   (*Disk*) or it can be set to have 3 (*Triangle*), 4 (*Square*), 5
   (*Pentagon*), 6 (*Hexagon*), 7 (*Heptagon*) or 8 blades
   (*Octagon*). The reason it does not go any higher than 8 is that from that point on the result tends to
   be indistinguishable from a *Disk* shape anyway.
Rotate
   This button is not visible if the *Bokeh Type* is set to *Disk*.
   It can be used to add an additional rotation offset to the Bokeh shape. The value is the angle in degrees.

Gamma Correct
   Exactly the same as the *Gamma* option in Blender's general *Blur* node (see `Blur Node`_).
   It can be useful to further brighten out of focus parts in the image, accentuating the Bokeh effect.

   Defocus node using Z-Buffer


fStop
   This is the most important parameter to control the amount of focal blur:
   it simulates the aperture *f* of a real lens(' iris) - without modifying the luminosity of the picture,
   however! As in a real camera, the *smaller* this number is, the more-open the lens iris is,
   and the *shallower* the depth-of-field will be. The default value 128 is assumed to be infinity:
   everything is in perfect focus. Half the value will double the amount of blur.
   This button is not available if *No zbuffer* is enabled.

Maxblur
   Use this to limit the amount of blur of the most out of focus parts of the image.
   The value is the maximum blur radius allowed.
   This can be useful since the actual blur process can sometimes be very slow. (The more blur, the slower it gets.)
   So, setting this value can help bring down processing times,
   like for instance when the world background is visible, which in general tends to be the point of maximum blur
   (not always true, objects very close to the lens might be blurred even more).
   The default value of 0 means there is no limit to the maximum blur amount.

BThreshold
   The defocus node is not perfect: some artifacts may occur.
   One such example is in-focus objects against a blurred background,
   which have a tendency to bleed into the edges of the sharp object.
   The worst-case scenario is an object in-focus against the very distant world background:
   the differences in distance are very large and the result can look quite bad.
   The node tries to prevent this from occurring by testing that the blur difference between pixels is not too large,
   the value set here controls how large that blur difference may be to consider it 'safe.' This is all probably
   quite confusing, and fortunately, in general, there is no need to change the default setting of 1.
   Only try changing it if you experience problems around any in-focus object.


Preview
   As already mentioned, processing can take a long time. So to help make editing parameters somewhat 'interactive',
   there is a preview mode which you can enable with this button.
   Preview mode will render the result using a limited amount of (quasi)random samples,
   which is a *lot* faster than the 'perfect' mode used otherwise. The sampling mode also tends to produce grainy,
   noisy pictures (though the more samples you use, the less noisy the result). This option is on by default.
   Play around with the other parameters until you are happy with the results,
   and only then disable the preview mode for the final render.


Samples
   Only visible when *Preview* is set. Sets the amount of samples to use to sample the image. The higher,
   the smoother the image, but also the longer the processing time. For preview,
   the default of 16 samples should be sufficient and is also the fastest.

No zbuffer
   Sometimes you might want to have more control to blur the image. For instance,
   you may want to only blur one object while leaving everything else alone (or the other way around),
   or you want to blur the whole image uniformly all at once.
   The node therefore allows you to use something other than an actual zbuffer as the *Z* input.
   For instance, you could connect an image node and use a grayscale image where the color designates how much to
   blur the image at that point, where white is maximum blur and black is no blur. Or,
   you could use a Time node to uniformly blur the image,
   where the time value controls the maximum blur for that frame.
   It may also be used to obtain a possibly slightly-better DoF blur,
   by using a fake depth shaded image instead of a zbuffer. (A typical method to create the fake depth shaded image
   is by using a linear blend texture for all objects in the scene or by using the 'fog/mist' fake depth shading
   method.) This also has the advantage that the fake depth image can have anti-aliasing,
   which is not possible with a real zbuffer.
   *No zbuffer* will be enabled automatically whenever you connect a node that is not image based
   (e.g. time node/value node/etc).

Zscale
   Only visible when *No zbuffer* enabled. When *No zbuffer* is used,
   the input is used directly to control the blur radius.
   And since usually the value of a texture is only in the numeric range 0.0 to 1.0,
   its range is too narrow to control the blur properly. This parameter can be used to expand the range of the input
   (or for that matter, narrow it as well, by setting it to a value less than one). So for *No zbuffer*,
   this parameter therefore then becomes the main blur control
   (similar to *fStop* when you *do* use a zbuffer).


Examples
========

.. figure:: /images/Manual-Node-Defocus-example.jpg
   :width: 200px
   :figwidth: 200px


In this `blend file example <http://wiki.blender.org/uploads/7/79/Doftest.blend>`__, the ball
array image is blurred as if it was taken by a camera with a f-stop of 2.8 resulting in a
farily narrow depth of field centered on 7.5 blender units from the camera.
As the balls receed into the distance, they get blurrier.


Hints
=====

Preview
   In general, use preview mode, change parameters to your liking,
   only then disable preview mode for the final render.
   This node is compute intensive, so watch your console window,
   and it will give you status as it computes each render scan line.
Edge Artifacts
   For minimum artifacts, try to setup your scene such that differences in distances between two objects that may
   visibly overlap at some point are not too large.
"Focus Pull"
   Keep in mind that this is not 'real' DoF, only a post-processing simulation.
   Some things cannot be done which would be no problem for real DoF at all.
   A typical example is a scene with some object very close to the camera,
   and the camera focusing on some point far behind it. In the real world, using shallow depth of field,
   it is not impossible for nearby objects to become completely invisible,
   in effect allowing the camera to see 'behind' it.
   Hollywood cinematographers use this visual characteristic to
   good effect to achieve the popular "focus pull" effect,
   where the focus shifts from a nearby to a distant object, such that the "other" object all but disappears.
   Well, this is simply not possible to do with the current post-processing method in a single pass.
   If you really want to achieve this effect, quite satisfactorily, here's how:

   - Split up your scene into "nearby" and "far" objects, and render them in two passes.
   - Now, combine the two the two results, each with their own "defocus" nodes driven by the same Time node,
     but with one of them inverted. (e.g. using a "Map Value" node with a Size of -1.)
     As the defocus of one increases,
     the defocus on the other decreases at the same rate, creating a smooth transition.


Aliasing at Low f-Stop Values
   At very low values, less than 5,
   the node will start to remove any oversampling and bring the objects at DoFDist very sharply into focus.
   If the object is against a constrasting background, this may lead to visible stairstepping (aliasing)
   which OSA is designed to avoid. If you run into this problem:

   - Do your own OSA by rendering at twice the intended size and then scaling down,
     so that adjacent pixels are blurred togther
   - Use the blur node with a setting of 2 for x and y
   - Set DoFDist off by a little, so that the object in focus is blurred by the tiniest bit.
   - Use a higher f-Stop, which will start the blur,
     and then use the Z socket to a Map Value to a Blur node to enhance the blur effect.
   - Rearrange the objects in your scene to use a lower-contrast background

No ZBuffer
   A final word of warning, since there is no way to detect if an actual zbuffer is connected to the node,
   be VERY careful with the *No ZBuffer* switch. If the *Zscale* value happens to be large,
   and you forget to set it back to some low value,
   the values may suddenly be interpreted as huge blur-radius values that will cause processing times to explode.
