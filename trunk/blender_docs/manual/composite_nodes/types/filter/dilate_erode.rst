   Dilate/Erode Node


This node blurs individual color channels. The color channel (or a black and white image)
is connected to the *Mask* input socket,
and the *Distance* is set manually (by clicking on the arrows or the value)
or automatically from a value node or a time-and-map-value noodle. A positive value of
*Distance* expands the influence of a pixel on its surrounding pixels,
thus blurring that color outward. A negative value erodes its influence,
thus increases the constrast of that pixel relative to its surrounding pixels,
thus sharpening it relative to surrounding pixels of the same color.


Example
=======

In this example image,
we wanted to take the rather boring array of ball bearings and spruce it up; make it hot,
baby. So, we dilated the red and eroded the green, leaving the blue alone.
If we had dilated both red and green...(hint: red and green make yellow).
The amount of influence is increased by increasing the *Distance* values.
