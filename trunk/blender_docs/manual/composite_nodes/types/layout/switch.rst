Switch Node

.. figure:: /images/composite_node_layout_switch.png

Switch between two images using a checkbox. When the checkbox is checked, the 'On' input is output.
When it is unchecked the 'Off' input is output instead.
Switch state may be animated by adding a :doc:`keyframe </animation/basics/key_frames>`
This makes the Switch node useful for bypassing nodes which are not wanted during part of a sequence.
