   Light
      Light is energy emitted by an atom. 
      It propagates independently of a medium with an constant speed *c*. (Einstein)


Light models
======================

.. glossary::

   Light models
      Often not describe a single light quantum (Planck), but light bundles.


Particle model
--------------

Properties: Rest mass, velocity, mass, impulse, energy, spin.


Wave model
----------

Analog model that compares light propagation with the propagation of i.e. water waves.
The main contribution is the combination of the theories of electrodynamics and magnetism (Maxwell's equations).

Properties: Frequency, wavelength, phase (phase velocity, group velocity), 
energy, angular frequency, amplitude, wave vector, polarization.


Shadow
======

Differentiated in two types: umbra, penumbra.


Light transport
===============

If a ray hit a atom or (matter) particle it changes is direction of propagation and 
transports information about the material it interacted with.
Light transport a simulation applying the light models as a simulation object.


Geometric Optics
----------------

.. glossary::

   Geometric optics
      Light propagates in straight lines. (Fermat's principle)

Applies the particle model.


Wave Optics
-----------

.. glossary::

   Wave optics
      Light propagates in not always straight lines.

Applies the wave model.
