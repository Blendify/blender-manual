Emission
========

.. glossary::

   Emission
      The :term:`phenomenon` of atoms or molecules sending out light.

Light is emitted by atoms or molecules on the transition of an electron 
from an energetic higher state to lesser state.
The interactions between atoms create intermediate energy levels.


Glow emission
-------------

.. glossary::

   Glow Emission
      Emission through the conversion of thermal energy.


Black body emission
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. glossary::

   Black body
   Black body radiation
      Is a model of :term:`glow emission`.

The intensity of the radiation is less dependent on the glowing substance itself, than the temperature.
The potential of radiation of a body is proportional to it's potential of absorption (Planck's radiation law).


Luminescence
------------

.. glossary::

   Luminescence
      If the primary cause of emission is not heat (cf. :term:`glow emission`).

Immediate absorption of energy (chemical, electric, radiation and physical), that excludes radioactivity.
Radiation out of the visible spectrum (optical brightener).


Absorption
==========

.. glossary::

   Absorption
      The energy is converted into the internal energy of the atom.

Most likely into movement of the atoms, which itself can evoke invisible infrared radiation.
Especially through the electrons interaction in conjugated systems {} molecules absorb visible light. 
The absence of light through absorption is the reason for the existence of shadows.


Transmission / transparency
===========================

.. glossary::

   Transmission
   Transparency
      Is the less occurrence of absorption in a medium.


Reflection
==========

.. glossary::

   Reflection
   Remission
      Describes the change of the propagation direction of light if it hit of an interface between to media in the way, 
      that the light runs back into the original medium.

See Bragg's law, Fresnel equations, Maxwell's equations.
It can also be called reemission, because the photon experience an absorption and an instantaneously emission.


Refraction
==========

.. glossary::

   Refraction
      Passover of the light ray at an interface of two media with change of propagation direction.


See Snell's law.


Interference, diffraction and scattering
========================================

.. glossary::

   Interference
      Interference describes the appearance of interference patterns. 
      Differentiated from scattering that it describe phenomena in smaller scale. 

   Diffraction
   Scattering 
      Describe phenomena with non linear direction of propagation.
