   Depth of field
   DOF
      The distance in front of and behind the subject which appears to be in focus.
      For any given lens setting, there is only one distance at which a subject is precisely in focus,
      but focus falls off gradually on either side of that distance,
      so there is a region in which the blurring is tolerable.
      This region is greater behind the point of focus than it is in front,
      as the angle of the light rays change more rapidly; they approach being parallel with increasing distance.

DOF might also referred to degrees of freedom.

   FOV
      The area in which objects are visible to the camera. Also see :term:`Focal Length <focal length>`

   Focal length
      The distance required by a lens to focus collimated light.
      Defines the magnification power of a lens. Also see :term:`Field of View <field of view>`

   Motion blur
      The phenomenon that occurs when we perceive a rapidly moving object.
      The object appears to be blurred, because of our persistence of vision.
      Simulating motion blur makes computer animation appear more realistic.
