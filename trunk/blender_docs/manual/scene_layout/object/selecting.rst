Selecting
*********

Selection determines which elements will be the target of our actions.
Selections work on the current scene visible objects.
Blender has advanced selection methods. Both in *Object Mode* and in *Edit Mode*.


.. _object-active:

Selections and the Active Object
================================

Blender distinguishes between two different states of selection:

.. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_object_selecting_introduction_color.png

   Unselected object in black, selected object in orange, and active object in yellow.

In *Object Mode* the last (de)selected item is called the "Active Object"
and is outlined in yellow (the others are orange).
There is at most one active object at any time.

Many actions in Blender use the active object as a reference (for example linking operations).
If you already have a selection and need to make a different object the active one,
simply re-select it with :kbd:`Shift-LMB`.

All other selected objects are just selected. You can select any number of objects.
In order to change a property or to perform an operation on all selected objects (bones, and sequencer strips)
hold :kbd:`Alt`, while confirming.


Point Selection
===============

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      All Modes
   :Hotkey:    :kbd:`LMB` and :kbd:`Shift-LMB`

The simplest form of object selection consists of using :kbd:`LMB` on it.
To add to the selection, use :kbd:`Shift-LMB` on more objects.
If the objects are overlapping in the view, you can use :kbd:`Alt-LMB`
to show a menu with possible choices (*Object Mode* only).

If you want to add to a selection this way then the shortcut becomes :kbd:`Shift-Alt-LMB`.
To activate an object that is already selected, click :kbd:`Shift-LMB` on it.

To *deselect* an active object,
click :kbd:`Shift-LMB` one time and hence, two clicks if the object is not active.
Note that this only works if there are no other objects under the mouse.
Otherwise it just adds those to the selection. There appears to be no workaround for this bug.

Also you can use :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` and :kbd:`Shift-Ctrl-LMB` shortcut
to select the object by its center point rather than its contents.


Interactive Selection Tools
===========================

.. _bpy.ops.view3d.select_border:

Box Select
----------

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Object Mode and Edit Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Select --> Box Select`
   :Hotkey:    :kbd:`B`

To activate the tool, press :kbd:`B` or click and drag :kbd:`LMB`.
With *Box Select* you draw a rectangle while holding down :kbd:`LMB`.
Any object that lies even partially within this rectangle becomes selected.
If any object that was last active appears in the selection it will become active.

For deselecting objects, use :kbd:`MMB`.


.. _bpy.ops.view3d.select_circle:

Circle Select
-------------

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Object Mode and Edit Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Select --> Circle Select`
   :Hotkey:    :kbd:`C`

*Circle Select* :kbd:`C` is used by moving with dotted circle through objects with :kbd:`LMB`.
You can select any object by touching of circle area.
It is possible to dynamically change the diameter of circle by scrolling :kbd:`Wheel`
or with :kbd:`NumpadPlus` and :kbd:`NumpadMinus` as seen in pictures below.
Deselection is under the same principle -- :kbd:`MMB`.
To cancel the selection use :kbd:`RMB` or key :kbd:`Esc` or :kbd:`Return`.


.. _bpy.ops.view3d.select_lasso:

Lasso Select
------------

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Object Mode and Edit Mode
   :Hotkey:    :kbd:`Ctrl-RMB`

Lasso select is used by drawing a dotted line around vertices or the origin of the objects,
in *Object Mode*. To use this hold :kbd:`Ctrl-RMB` and simply draw around the points you want to select.

Lasso select adds to the previous selection. For deselection, use :kbd:`Shift-Ctrl-LMB`.

   :Mode:      All Modes
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Select --> None`,
   :Hotkey:    :kbd:`Alt-A`

The types are Mesh, Curve, Surface, Meta, Font,
Armature, Lattice, Empty, Camera, Lamp, Speaker.

   :Hotkey:    :kbd:`Ctrl-NumpadPlus`, :kbd:`Ctrl-NumpadMinus`

Their purpose, based on the hierarchical.

More
   Expand the selection to the immediate parent and children of the selected objects.
Less
   Contrast the selection, deselect objects at the boundaries of parent/child relationships.
Parent
   Deselects the currently selected objects and selects their immediate parents.

There are two ways to organize the objects in relation to one another.
The first one is *parenting*, and the second is simple *grouping*.
These relationships to an artist's advantage by selecting members of respective families or groups.
*Select Grouped* uses the active object as a basis to select all others.

Immediate Children
   Selects all direct children of the active object.
Parent

   If the active object belongs to more than one collection,
   a list will pop up so that you can choose which collection to select.
Object Hooks
   Every hook that belongs to the active object.
Pass
   Select objects assigned to the same :ref:`render pass <render-cycles-passes>`.
Color
   Select objects with same :ref:`Object Color <objects-display-object-color>`.

*Select Linked* uses the active object as a basis to select all others.

Object Data
   Selects every object that is linked to the same Object Data, i.e.
   the data-block that specifies the type (mesh, curve, etc.) and the build
   (constitutive elements like vertices, control vertices, and where they are in space) of the object.
Material
   Selects every object that is linked to the same material data-block.
Instanced Collection

Library
   Selects all objects that are in the same :doc:`Library </files/linked_libraries>`.
Library (Object Data)
   Selects all objects that are in the same :doc:`Library </files/linked_libraries>`
   and limited to *Object Data*.


.. _bpy.ops.object.select_pattern:

Select Pattern
--------------

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Object Mode
