*Only Origins* is located inside the Pivot Point control of the 3D View.
When this option is enabled, the transformation will change the positions
of the object's origins, but will not affect the object itself.

In the examples below, a comparison of the scaling and rotation of objects,
when *Only Origins* is enabled (middle) and disabled (right).
