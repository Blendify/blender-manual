   View layers and collections.

View layers reference to :doc:`collections </scene_layout/collections/introduction>`,
and allow to set their visibility, selectability and other options.
A *view layer* can have any collection enabled, and multiple *view layers*
can use the same or different collections.

   Each view layer can be rendered separately as invididual
   :doc:`Render Layers </render/layers/layers>` to help composite your scene.

========

You can edit the current *view layer* collections in the :doc:`Outliner </editors/outliner>`.
