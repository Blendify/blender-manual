  Pipeline

This section of the manual focuses on the integration of Blender into a production pipeline.
This is a vast topic that covers many areas of the software,
but here we will focus on file/asset management and data I/O.

.. note::

   The tools and workflows documented here require familiarity with working
   with a command line interface and are mostly aimed at TDs and technical users.

BAM Asset Manager
=================

Refactoring linked .blend files is a common practice in a production environment.
While some basic operations can be accomplished within Blender,
sometimes it is more practical to perform them on the command line or via a script.
During the production of Cosmos Laundromat (Gooseberry Open Movie Project)
the *BAM Asset Manager* (BAM) was developed. The original scope of BAM included
client-server asset management tools going beyond Blender,
but it was later refocused on core utilities to perform two operations:

- blendfile packing
- automatic dependencies remapping

The following section of the manual focuses on how to use BAM.

Installing BAM
--------------
BAM is a standalone Python package, that can be run on any system without any particular configuration.
The only requirement is Python 3 (and pip, the Python package manager, to easily install BAM).

Windows, Linux and macOS provide different ways to install Python 3 and pip.
Check out the online docs to learn more about a specific platform.

Once Python 3 and pip are available, BAM can be installed via command line by typing:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip3 install blender-bam

After a successful installation, the `bam` command will be available.
By typing it and pressing the Enter key, all the available subcommands will be displayed.


bam pack
--------

This command is used for packing a ``.blend`` file and *all*
its dependencies into a ``.zip`` file for redistribution.

::

   usage: bam pack [-h] [-o FILE] [-m MODE] [-e PATTERNS] [-a] [-q] [-c LEVEL]
                paths [paths ...]

You can simply pack a blend file like this to create a zip-file of the same name.

.. code-block:: sh

   bam pack /path/to/scene.blend

You may also want to give an explicit output directory.
The example shows how to pack a blend with maximum compression for online downloads

.. code-block:: sh

   bam pack /path/to/scene.blend --output my_scene.zip --compress=best

The command provides several options to adapt to different workflows
(final distribution, partial extraction, rendering).

``-o``, ``--output`` ``<FILE>``
   Output file or a directory when multiple inputs are passed
``-m``, ``--mode`` ``<MODE>``
   Output file or a directory when multiple inputs are passed. Possible choices: ``ZIP``, ``FILE``
``-e``, ``--exclude`` ``<PATTERN(S)>``
   Optionally exclude files from the pack.

   ``--exclude="*.png"``
      Using Unix shell-style wildcards *(case insensitive)*.
   ``--exclude="*.txt;*.avi;*.wav"``
      Multiple patterns can be passed using the ``;`` separator.
``-a``, ``--all-deps``
   Follow all dependencies (unused indirect dependencies too)
``-q``, ``--quiet``
   Suppress status output
``-c``, ``--compress`` ``<LEVEL>``
   Compression level for resulting archive
   Possible choices: ``default``, ``fast``, ``best``, ``store``
``--repo`` ``<DIR PATH>``
   Specify a "root" path from where to pack the selected file.
   This allows for the creation of a sparse copy of the production tree, without any remapping.
``--warn-external``
   Report external libraries errors (missing paths)


Examples
^^^^^^^^

Consider the following directory layout,
and in particular the file *01_01_A.lighting.blend* with its linked libraries.

.. code-block:: sh

   ~/agent327/
   └─ lib/
      ├─ chars/
      |  ├─ agent.blend  ------------->|
      |  ├─ boris.blend  ------------->|
      |  └─ barber.blend               |
      └─ scenes/                       |
         ├─ 01-opening                 |
         ├─ 01_01_A.lighting.blend  <--|  < BAM pack this file
         └─ 01_01_A.anim.blend  ------>|


Once we run ``bam pack /scenes/01-opening/01_01_A.lighting.blend``
we obtain a *01_01_A.lighting.zip* inside of which we find the following structure.

.. code-block:: sh

   ~/01_01_A.lighting
      ├─ 01_01_A.lighting.blend
      └─ __/
         ├─ 01_01_A.anim.blend
         └─ __/
            └─ lib/
               └─ chars/
                  ├─ agent.blend
                  └─ boris.blend

Note how all paths have been remapped relative to the placement
of *01_01_A.lighting.blend* in the root of the output.
If we run ``bam pack /scenes/01-opening/01_01_A.lighting.blend --repo ~/agent327``,
the output will be different.

.. code-block:: sh

   ~/01_01_A.lighting
      ├─ lib/
      |  └─ chars/
      |     ├─ agent.blend
      |     └─ boris.blend
      └─ scenes
         └─ 01-opening/
            ├─ 01_01_A.lighting.blend  < The BAM packed file
            └─ 01_01_A.anim.blend

In this case no path is remapped, and we simply strip out any file
that is not referenced as a direct or indirect dependency of *01_01_A.lighting.blend*.
This is effectively a sparse copy of the original production tree.


bam remap
---------

Remap blend file paths

::

   usage: bam remap [-h] {start,finish,reset} ...

This command is a 3 step process:

- first run ``bam remap start .`` which stores the current state of your project (recursively).
- then re-arrange the files on the filesystem (rename, relocate).
- finally run ``bam remap finish`` to apply the changes, updating the ``.blend`` files internal paths.


.. code-block:: sh

   cd /my/project

   bam remap start .
   mv photos textures
   mv barbershop_v14_library.blend barberhop_libraray.blend
   bam remap finish

.. note::

   Remapping creates a file called ``bam_remap.data`` in the current directory.
   You can relocate the entire project to a new location but on executing ``finish``,
   this file must be accessible from the current directory.

.. note::

   This command depends on files unique contents,
   take care not to modify the files once remap is started.
