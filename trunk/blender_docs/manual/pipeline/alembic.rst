From the `Alembic home page <https://www.alembic.io/>`_:

   Alembic is an open computer graphics interchange framework. Alembic distills complex, animated
   scenes into a non-procedural, application-independent set of baked geometric results. This
   'distillation' of scenes into baked geometry is exactly analogous to the distillation of
   lighting and rendering scenes into rendered image data.

   Alembic is focused on efficiently storing the computed results of complex procedural geometric
   constructions. It is very specifically NOT concerned with storing the complex dependency graph
   of procedural tools used to create the computed results. For example, Alembic will efficiently
   store the animated vertex positions and animated transforms that result from an arbitrarily
   complex animation and simulation process which could involve enveloping, corrective shapes,
   volume-preserving simulations, cloth and flesh simulations, and so on. Alembic will not attempt
   to store a representation of the network of computations (rigs, basically) which are required to
   produce the final, animated vertex positions and animated transforms.

:abbr:`TL;DR (Too long; didn't read.)`: Alembic can be used to write an animated mesh to disk, and
read it back quickly & efficiently. This means that a mesh can be animated with a very CPU-heavy rig,
'baked' to an Alembic file, and loaded into the shot file for shading and lighting
with only moderate CPU usage.

Support for the Alembic file format was introduced in
`Blender 2.78 <https://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Dev:Ref/Release_Notes/2.78>`_.

Due to the Open Source nature of the Alembic standard, as well as the C++ library implementing that
standard, **Blender can be used in a hybrid pipeline**. For example, other software, such as Houdini
or Maya, can export files to Alembic, which can then be loaded, shaded, and rendered in Blender. It
is also possible to animate characters (or other models) in Blender, export to Alembic, and load
those files into other software for further processing.


Exporting to Alembic Files
==========================

This section describes the effect of the different export options.

   Alembic Export options.


Manual Transform
----------------

Scale
   This sets the global scale of the Alembic file. Keep it at the default value of 1.0 to use
   Blender's units.


Scene Options
-------------

Start Frame and End Frame
   Sets the frame range to export to Alembic. This defaults to the current scene frame range.
Sub-frame sampling: Transform & Geometry Samples, Shutter Open & Close
   These options control the sub-frame sampling of animations. Transform Samples sets the number
   of times per frame at which animated transformations are sampled and written to Alembic.
   Geometry Samples sets the same, but then for animated geometry. Shutter Open & Close define the
   interval [open, close] over which those samples are taken. The valid range is -1 to 1, where -1
   indicates the previous frame, 0 indicates the current frame, and 1 indicates the next frame.
   For example, if information for detailed mesh motion blur is desired, some subframes around the
   current frame can be written to Alembic by using a sample count of 5, Shutter Open at -0.25 and
   Shutter Close at 0.25. This mimics a "180 degree" shutter, opening 90 degrees before the frame
   and closing 90 degrees after the frame.
Selected Objects Only
   When enabled, exports only the selected objects. When disabled, all objects are exported.
Renderable Objects Only
   This is useful to, for example, avoid exporting custom bone shapes.
Visible Layers Only
   Limits the export to scene layers that are currently visible.
Flatten Hierarchy
   When disabled, parent/child relations between objects are exported too. Any parent object that
   is not exported itself, but with children that *are* exported, is replaced by an Empty.
   When enabled, parent/child relations are not exported, and transformations are all written in
   world coordinates.


Object Options
--------------

UVs
   When enabled, UV maps are exported. Although the Alembic standard only supports a single UV
   map, Blender exports all UV maps in a way that should be readable by other software.
Pack UV Islands
   TODO: figure out & describe what this does.
Normals
   TODO: figure out & describe what this does.
Vertex Colors
   When enabled, exports vertex colors. At this moment, this only supports static vertex colors,
   and not dynamically animated vertex colors.
Face Sets
   TODO: figure out & describe what this does.
Use Subdivision Schema
   When enabled, writes polygonal meshes using the "SubD" Alembic schema, rather than the
   "PolyMesh" schema.
Apply Subdivision Surface
   TODO: figure out & describe what this does.
Triangulate
   Triangulates the mesh before writing to Alembic.


Particle Systems
----------------

Alembic has no support for Particle Systems, in the same way that it does not support armatures.
Hair is exported as animated zero-width curves. Particles are exported as animated points.
