Conversion
==========

As there are only NURBS surfaces, there is no "internal" conversion here.

However, there is an "external" conversion available, from surface to mesh,
that only works in *Object Mode*.
It transforms a *Surface* object into a *Mesh* one,
using the surface resolutions in both directions to create faces, edges and vertices.
