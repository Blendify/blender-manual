Conversion
==========

As there are only NURBS surfaces, there is no "internal" conversion here.

However, there is an "external" conversion available, from surface to mesh,
that only works in *Object Mode*.
It transforms a *Surface* object into a *Mesh* one,
using the surface resolutions in both directions to create faces, edges and vertices.


Misc Editing
============

You have some of the same options as with meshes, or in *Object Mode*.
You can :ref:`separate <object-separate>` a given surface :kbd:`P`,
make other selected objects :ref:`children <object-parenting>`
of one or three control points :kbd:`Ctrl-P`,
or :doc:`add hooks </modeling/modifiers/deform/hooks>` to control some points with other objects.
