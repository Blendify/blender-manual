Surface Primitives
******************

To help get started in creating surfaces there are four preset NURBS surfaces, found in the
:menuselection:`Add --> Surface --> NURBS Surface`, :menuselection:`NURBS Tube`,
:menuselection:`NURBS Sphere` and :menuselection:`NURBS Torus`.

   NURBS surface primitives.


There are also two preset NURBS surface curves (with only one control point on each V-row):
*NURBS Curve* and *NURBS Circle*.

   NURBS curve primitives.


Note how a circle NURBS surface is never filled, unlike its "real" curve counterpart...
