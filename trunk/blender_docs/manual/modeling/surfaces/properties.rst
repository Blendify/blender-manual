   Surface Properties.

The panels of the *Curve and Surface* tab are the same as for
:doc:`curves </modeling/curves/introduction>`, just with fewer options...


Shape

   Shape panel.

You can adjust the resolution separately for both preview and render,
to not slow things down in the viewport, but still get good render results.

Closed and Open Surfaces
------------------------

Like curves, surfaces can be closed (cyclical) or open, independently in both directions,
allowing you to easily create a tube, donut or sphere shape,
and they can be drawn as "solids" in *Edit Mode*.
This makes working with surfaces quite easy.


Bézier
------


Endpoint
--------

Just like :ref:`NURBS curves <modeling-curve-knot>`, NURBS surfaces have two knot vectors,
one for each U and V axis. Here again, they can be one of *Cyclic*, *Endpoint*,
or *Bézier*, with the same properties as for curves. And as with curves, only open surfaces
(in the relevant direction) are affected by this setting...

.. _fig-surface-intro-endpoint:

.. figure:: /images/modeling_surfaces_introduction_endpoint.png

   Endpoint U.


In Fig. :ref:`fig-surface-intro-endpoint` the U interpolation axis is labeled as "U" and the V
interpolation axis is labeled as "V". The U's interpolation axis has
been set to *Endpoint* and as such the surface now extends to the outer edges from
E1 to E2 along the U interpolation axis.

To cause the surface to extend to all edges you would set the V's axis to
*Endpoint* as well.


Order
-----

One more time, this property is the same as with :ref:`NURBS Curves <modeling-curve-order>`;
it specifies how much the control points are taken into account for calculating the curve of the surface shape.
For high Orders 1 the surface pulls away from the control points,
creating a smoother surface by assuming that the
`Resolution`_ is high enough. For lowest Orders 2 the surface follows the control points,
creating a surface that tends to follow the grid cage.

.. _fig-surface-intro-order:

.. figure:: /images/modeling_surfaces_introduction_order.png

   Order 2 and order 4 surface.


For illustration purposes, in both Fig. :ref:`fig-surface-intro-order`,
the knot vectors were set to *Endpoint*, causing the surface to extend to all edges.

You can set independently the order for each interpolation axis, and like curves,
it **cannot** be lower than 2,
and higher than 6 or the number of control points on the relevant axis.


Resolution
----------

Just like :ref:`NURBS curves <curve-nurbs>`, *Resolution* controls the detail of the surface.
The higher the *Resolution* the more detailed and smoother the surface is.
The lower the *Resolution* the rougher the surface. However, here you have two resolution settings,
one for each interpolation axis (U and V). Note that unlike with curves, you have only one resolution
(the *Resolution* U and V fields, in the *Curve Tools* panel)...

Fig. :ref:`fig-surface-intro-resolution1` is an example of a surface resolution of 1 for both U and V.
Fig. :ref:`fig-surface-intro-resolution2` surface is an example of a surface resolution of 3 for both U and V.
