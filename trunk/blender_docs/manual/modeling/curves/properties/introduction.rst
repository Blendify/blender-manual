Attributes
==========

Weight
------

This sets the "goal weight" of selected control points,
which is used when a curve has :doc:`Soft Body </physics/soft_body/index>` physics,
forcing the curve to "stick" to their original positions, based on the weight.


Radius
------

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Edit Mode
   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Tool Shelf --> Tools --> Radius`
               :menuselection:`Sidebar region --> Transform --> Radius`
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Curve --> Transform --> Radius`
   :Hotkey:    :kbd:`Alt-S`

The Radius allows you to directly control the width of the extrusion along the "spinal" curve.
The *Radius* of the points is set using the *Radius* transform tool. Or in the Siderbar *Transform* panel.

   One control point radius set to zero.


Tilt
----

This setting controls how the normals (visualization: arrows)
twist around each control point -- so it is only relevant with 3D curves!
You set it using the *Tilt* transform tool in the Tool Shelf,
the :menuselection:`Sidebar region --> Transform --> Tilt`,
:menuselection:`Curve --> Transform --> Tilt`.

You can also reset it to its default value (i.e. perpendicular to the original curve plane)
with :kbd:`Alt-T`, :menuselection:`Curve --> Control Points --> Clear Tilt`.
With NURBS, the tilt is always smoothly interpolated.
However, with BÃ©zier, you can choose the interpolation algorithm
between Linear, Ease, B-Spline, and Cardinal,
in the :menuselection:`Properties Editor --> Object Data --> Active Spline --> Tilt`.
