Extrude
   Turns an one dimensional curve into a two dimensional curve by giving it height.
   Note that this is not related to *Extrude* used in mesh edit-mode.
   With a scale of one,
   an *Extrusion* of 0.5 will extrude the curve 0.5 BU in both directions, perpendicular to the curves normals.

             Extruded by 0.5 (Object Mode).

Tilt
   This setting controls how the normals (visualization: arrows)
   twist around each control point -- so it is only relevant with 3D curves!
   You set it using the *Tilt* transform tool in the :kbd:`T` tool shelf,
   the :kbd:`N` :menuselection:`--> transform --> Mean tilt`, :menuselection:`Curve --> Transform --> Tilt`.

   You can also reset it to its default value (i.e. perpendicular to the original curve plane)
   with :kbd:`Alt-T`, :menuselection:`Curve --> Control Points --> Clear Tilt`.
   With NURBS, the tilt is always smoothly interpolated.
   However, with Bézier, you can choose the interpolation algorithm between
   Linear, Ease, B-Spline, and Cardinal, in the
   :menuselection:`Properties Editor --> Object Data --> Active Spline --> Tilt`.

   .. figure:: /images/modeling_curves_editing_extrude_example-3_mean-tilt.png

      30 degree Mean Tilt of all control points.

Bevel Depth
   This will add a bevel to the extrusion. See below for its effects...
   Note that the bevel makes the extrusion wider and higher.
   If set to 0.0, there is no bevel.

   .. figure:: /images/modeling_curves_editing_extrude_example-4_bevel-depth.png

      Bevel depth of 0.25, fill set to full, zero Mean Tilt.

Bevel Resolution
   Controls the resolution of the bevel created by a *Bevel Depth* higher than zero.
   If set the to 0 (the default), the bevel is a simple "flat" surface.
   Higher values will smooth, round off the bevel, similar to the resolution settings of the curve itself...

   .. figure:: /images/modeling_curves_editing_extrude_example-5_bevel-resolution.png

      Bevel resolution set to 10.

Offset
   Moves the extrusion parallel to the curve normals. *Almost like scaling*

   .. figure:: /images/modeling_curves_editing_extrude_example-6_offset.png

      -1 offset, 0.5 extrusion, 0.25 Bevel Depth, 10 Bevel resolution.

Radius
   The Radius allows you to directly control the width of the extrusion along the “spinal” curve.
   The *Radius* of the points is set using the *Shrink/Fatten Radius* transform tool :kbd:`Alt-S`,
   the :menuselection:`Curve --> Transform --> Shrink/Fatten Radius`,
   or the :kbd:`N` :menuselection:`--> transform --> Radius`.

   .. figure:: /images/modeling_curves_editing_extrude_example-7_radius.png

      One control point radius set to zero.

   .. tip::

      Remember, these curves can be converted into meshes with :kbd:`Alt-C` in Object Mode

We have three sub-classes of results, depending on whether the curve is open or closed or 3D:

Open 2D Curve
   The extrusion will create a "wall" or "ribbon" following the curve shape. If using a *Bevel Depth*,
   the wall becomes a sort of slide or gutter.
   If your normals are facing the wrong way you can switch their direction as shown
   :ref:`here <curve-switch-direction>`

   .. figure:: /images/modeling_curves_editing_extrude_example-8_open-curve.png

      Open 2D Curve with :kbd:`Alt-C`, fill set to none,
      zero offset, 0.5 extrusion, 0.25 Bevel Depth, 10 Bevel resolution.

Closed 2D Curve
   This is probably the most useful situation, as it will quickly create a volume, with (by default)
   two flat and parallel surfaces filling the two sides of the extruded "wall". You can remove one or both of these
   faces by choosing the fill mode: both, front, back, or none.

   The optional bevel depth will always create a 90 degree bevels here.

   .. figure:: /images/modeling_curves_editing_extrude_example-9_closed-curve.png

      Closed 2D Curve, 0.5 extrude, 0.25 Bevel Depth, 10 Bevel resolution, Fill: Both.

3D Curve
   Here the fact that the curve is closed or not has no importance --
   you will never get a volume with an extruded 3D curve, only a wall or ribbon, like with open 2D curves.

   However, there is one more feature with 3D curves: the *Tilt* of the control points (see above).
   It will make the ribbon twist around the curve to create a mobius strip, for example.


Advanced Extrusion
------------------

These extrusions use one or two additional curve objects,
to create very complex organic shapes.

To enable this type of extrusion, you have to type a valid curve object name in the
*Bevel Object* field of the curve you are going to use as the "spinal column" of your
extrusion. The "bevel" curve will control the cross section of the extruded object.
Whether the *Bevel Object* curve is 2D or 3D has no importance, but if it is closed,
it will create a "tube-like" extrusion;
otherwise you will get a sort of gutter or slide object...

The object is extruded along the whole length of all internal curves. By default,
the width of the extrusion is constant, but you have two ways to control it,
the *Radius* property of control points (see above), and the "taper" object.

The taper curve is evaluated along *the local X axis*,
using *the local Y axis* for width control. Note also that:

- It must be an *open curve*.
- The taper is applied independently to all curves of the extruded object.
- Only the first curve in a *Taper Object* is evaluated, even if you have several separated segments.
- The scaling starts at the first control-point on the left
  and moves along the curve to the last control-point on the right.
- Negative scaling, (negative local Y on the taper curve) is possible as well.
  However, rendering artifacts may appear.
- Might need to increase the curve resolution to see more detail of the taper
- With closed curves, the taper curve in *Taper Object* acts along the whole curve (perimeter of the object),
  not just the length of the object, and varies the extrusion depth. In these cases,
  you want the relative height of the *Taper Object*
  Taper curve at both ends to be the same, so that the cyclic point
  (the place where the endpoint of the curve connects to the beginning) is a smooth transition.


Examples
========

.. TODO: add some "simple" extrusion examples.
   TODO: add some "bevel" extrusion with *Radius* examples.

Let us taper a simple curve circle extruded object using a taper curve. Add a curve,
then exit *Edit Mode*. Add another one (a closed one, like a circle); call it "BevelCurve",
and enter its name in the *Bevel Object* field of the first curve
(*Curve and Surface* tab). We now have a pipe.
Add a third curve while in *Object Mode* and call it "TaperCurve".
Adjust the left control-point by raising it up about 5 units.

Now return to the Object tab,
and edit the first curve's *Taper Object* field in the Curve and Surface panel to reference the new taper curve
which we called "TaperCurve".
When you hit enter the taper curve is applied immediately,
with the results shown in Fig. :ref:`fig-curves-extrude-taber-curve`.

       .. figure:: /images/modeling_curves_editing_extrude_example-10_bevel-object.png

          Circle curve set as Bevel Object.

          :width: 320px

          Taper extruded curve.


You can see the *taper curve* being applied to the *extruded object*.
Notice how the pipe's volume shrinks to nothing as the taper curve goes from left to right.
If the taper curve went below the local Y axis the pipe's inside would become the outside,
which would lead to rendering artifacts.
Of course as an artist that may be what you are looking for!

   Taper example 1.


In Fig. :ref:`fig-curves-extrude-taber1`
you can clearly see the effect the left taper curve has on the right curve object. Here the
left taper curve is closer to the object center and that results in a smaller curve object to
the right.

   Taper example 2.


In Fig. :ref:`fig-curves-extrude-taber2` a control point in the taper curve to the left is moved away from the
center and that gives a wider result to the curve object on the right.

   Taper example 3.


In Fig. :ref:`fig-curves-extrude-taber3` we see the use of a more irregular taper curve applied to a curve circle.
