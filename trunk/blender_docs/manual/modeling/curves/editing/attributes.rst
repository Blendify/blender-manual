Weight
======

This sets the "goal weight" of selected control points,
which is used when a curve has :doc:`Soft Body </physics/soft_body/index>` physics,
forcing the curve to "stick" to their original positions, based on the weight.


Radius
======

.. admonition:: Reference

   :Mode:      Edit Mode
   :Tool:      :menuselection:`Tool Shelf --> Radius`
   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Sidebar --> Transform --> Radius`
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Curve --> Transform --> Radius`
   :Hotkey:    :kbd:`Alt-S`

The Radius allows you to directly control the width of the extrusion along the "spinal" curve.
The *Radius* of the points is set using the *Radius* transform tool. Or in the Siderbar *Transform* panel.

   One control point radius set to zero.


Tilt
====

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Edit Mode
   :Tool:      :menuselection:`Tool Shelf --> Tilt`
   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Sidebar --> Transform --> Tilt`
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Control Points --> Tilt`
   :Hotkey:    :kbd:`Ctrl-T`

This setting controls how the normals (visualized as arrows)
twist around each control point -- so it is only relevant with 3D curves!

.. figure:: /images/modeling_curves_properties_introduction_extrude-mean-tilt.png
   :width: 320px

   30 degree Mean Tilt of all control points.


Clear Tilt
----------

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Edit Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Control Points --> Clear Tilt`
   :Hotkey:    :kbd:`Alt-T`

You can also reset the tilt to its default value (i.e. perpendicular to the original curve plane).
With NURBS, the tilt is always smoothly interpolated. However, with BÃ©zier,
you can choose the :ref:`interpolation algorithm <bpy.types.Spline.tilt_interpolation>`.
