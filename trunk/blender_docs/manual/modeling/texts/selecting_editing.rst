*******************
Selecting & Editing
*******************

Editing text is quite different from other object types in Blender, and happens mainly in two areas.
First, the 3D View, where you type your text, and have a few shortcuts, e.g. for applying
styles (see :ref:`modeling-text-character`) -- note however, that most Blender hotkeys you know
in *Edit Mode* do not exist for texts. The second place is the Properties Editor, especially the *Font* tab.


Selecting & Cursor
==================

.. figure:: /images/modeling_texts_selecting-editing_cursor.png
   :width: 340px

   Text in Edit Mode.

In *Edit Mode*, your text has a white cursor, and as in any text editor,
it determines where new chars will be inserted.

Next/Previous Character
   You can move the cursor with the arrow keys :kbd:`Left` or :kbd:`Right`.
Next/Previous Word
   To move the cursor on a word's boundary, use :kbd:`Ctrl-Left` or :kbd:`Ctrl-Right`.
Line Begin/End
   :kbd:`Home` and :kbd:`End` move the cursor to the beginning and end of a line respectively.
Next/Previous Line
   To jump between lines, use :kbd:`Up` or :kbd:`Down`.
Next/Previous Page
   To jump back/forward ten lines at a time, use :kbd:`PageUp` or :kbd:`PageDown`.

Hold :kbd:`Shift` while using the arrow keys to select a part of the text.
You can use it to specify different materials, the normal/bold/italic style,
and not much more.


Editing
=======

The menu of the 3D View header offers few options,
and there is no *Specials* menu. You have no transform nor mirror tools, and so on.
However, you can apply to texts the same modifiers as for curves.


Basic
-----

Editing *Text* is similar to using a standard text editor but is not as
full-featured and has some differences:

Exit *Edit Mode*
   :kbd:`Tab` does not insert a tab character in the text,
   but rather enters and exits *Edit Mode*, as with other object types.
Copy
   To copy text to the buffer, use :kbd:`Ctrl-C` or the *Copy* button in the Tool Shelf.
Cut and Copy
   To cut and copy text to the buffer, use :kbd:`Ctrl-X` or the *Cut* button in the Tool Shelf.
Paste
   To paste text from the buffer, use :kbd:`Ctrl-V` or the *Paste* button in the Tool Shelf.
Delete all text
   To completely erase or delete all text, use :kbd:`Ctrl-Backspace`.

The text buffer is in sync with the desktop clipboard.
But if it is used within Blender the text formatting will be copied as well.
For other ways of inserting a text, see `Inserting Text`_ below.


Special Characters
------------------

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Edit Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Text --> Special Characters`

If you need special characters (such as accented chars, which are not on your keyboard)
you can produce many of them using a combination of two other characters. To do so,
type the main char, press :kbd:`Alt-Backspace`,
and then press the desired "modifier" to produce the special character.
Some examples are given below:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80

   * - |atilde|

     - :kbd:`A`, :kbd:`Alt-Backspace`, :kbd:`~`

   * - |aacute|

     - :kbd:`A`, :kbd:`Alt-Backspace`, :kbd:`'`

   * - |agrave|

     - :kbd:`A`, :kbd:`Alt-Backspace`, :kbd:`\\`

   * - |aring|

     - :kbd:`A`, :kbd:`Alt-Backspace`, :kbd:`O`

   * - |euml|

     - :kbd:`E`, :kbd:`Alt-Backspace`, :kbd:`"`

   * - |oslash|

     - :kbd:`O`, :kbd:`Alt-Backspace`, :kbd:`/`


Inserting Text
--------------

You can insert text in two ways: from the internal text buffer
(as described above), or from a text file.

To load text from a text file, use the :menuselection:`Text --> Paste File` tool.
This will bring up a :doc:`File Browser </editors/file_browser/index>` for navigating to a valid UTF-8 file.
As usual, be careful that the file does not have too many characters,
as interactive response will slow down.


Setting Case
------------

You can change the text case by selecting it then clicking the *To Upper* or
*To Lower* in the Tool Shelf.

Blender's *Bold* and *Italic* buttons do not work the same way as other applications,
as they also serve as placeholders for you to load up other fonts manually,
which get applied when you define the corresponding style; see :ref:`Font <modeling-text-character>`.

To apply the Bold/Italics/Underline attribute to a set of characters, you either turn on
*Bold* / *Italics* / *Underline* prior to typing characters,
or highlight (select) first and then toggle Bold/Italics/Underline.


Loading and Changing Fonts
--------------------------

Blender comes with a *built-in* font by default that is displayed in
each of the four font style data-block menus.
The *built-in* font is always present and shows in this list as "Bfont".
The data-block menu contains a list displaying the currently loaded fonts.
Select one for each font style.

To load a different *Font*, click one of the *Load* buttons
in the *Font* panel and navigate to a font file.
The :doc:`File Browser </editors/file_browser/index>` will give all valid fonts a capital "F" icon.

If you select a font that is unsupported by Blender, you will get the error ``Not a valid font``.

.. note:: Location of Fonts on Unix

   Fonts are typically located under ``/usr/lib/fonts``, or some variant like ``/usr/lib/X11/fonts``,
   but not always. They may be in other locations as well,
   such as ``/usr/share/local`` or ``/usr/local/share``, and possibly related sub-trees.

Remember the same font will be applied to all chars with same style in a text,
but that a separate font is required for each style.
For example, you will need to load an *Italics* font in order to make characters or words italic.
Once the font is loaded you can apply that font "Style" to the selected characters or the whole object.
In all, you would need to load a minimum of four different types of fonts to represent each style
(Normal, Italics, Bold, Bold-Italics).

It is important to understand, that Blender does not care what font
you load for "normal", "bold", etc., styles.
This is how you can have up to four different fonts in use in the same text,
but you have to choose between different styles of a same font, or different fonts.
Blender has a number of typographic controls for changing the style and layout of text,
found in the *Font* panel.


Converting Text Objects
-----------------------

Converting to Text Object
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using an existing text data-block, you can convert it to an object from the Text editor's header,
select :menuselection:`Edit --> Text to 3D Object`,
*One Object* or *One Object per Line* depending on your needs.

It is also possible to paste from the clipboard or a file from the *Edit* menu, while editing 3D Text.


Converting to 3D Mesh
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is possible to convert a Text Object to a 3D Mesh object.
This can be useful so that you may edit the vertices in *Edit Mode*,
but you will lose the ability to edit the text itself.

This can be done, using :ref:`object-convert-to` in *Object Mode*.
Now you can return to *Edit Mode* and manually edit the vertices.

.. tip::

   The result is usually a bit messy, so it may be useful to use a *Limited Dissolve* deletion or *Remesh* Object
   :doc:`Modifier </modeling/modifiers/index>` at a low threshold to clean up your mesh.


Assigning Materials
-------------------

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Edit Mode
   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Properties editor --> Materials`

Each character can have a different *Material index* in order to have different
materials on different characters.

You can assign indices either as you type, or after by selecting blocks of text and
clicking on the *Assign* button in the Materials panel.

.. _fig-texts-edit-rgb:

.. figure:: /images/modeling_texts_selecting-editing_material-index-example.png

   Red Green Blue.

For example, to create Fig. :ref:`fig-texts-edit-rgb`
you would need to create three separate materials and three separate material indices.
Each word would be assigned a *Material index* by selecting the characters for each word
and clicking the *Assign* button. Fig. :ref:`fig-texts-edit-rgb` is still one single *Text* object.
