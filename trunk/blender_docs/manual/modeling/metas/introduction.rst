*Meta* objects are *implicit surfaces*,
meaning that they are *not explicitly* defined by vertices (as meshes are)
or control points (as surfaces are): they exist *procedurally*.
Meta objects are literally mathematical formulas that are calculated on-the-fly by Blender.

A very distinct visual characteristic of metas is that they are fluid *mercurial*,
or *clay-like* forms that have a "rounded" shape. Furthermore,
when two meta objects get close to one another, they begin to interact with one another.
They "blend" or "merge", as water droplets do, especially in zero-g (which, by the way,
makes them very handy for modeling streams of water when you do not want to do a fluid simulation).
If they subsequently move away from one another, they restore their original shape.

Each of these is defined by its own underlying mathematical :doc:`structure </modeling/metas/structure>`,
and you can at any time switch between them using the *Active Element* panel.

Typically *Meta* objects are used for special effects or as a basis for modeling.
For example, you could use a collection of metas to form the initial shape of your model and
then convert it to a mesh for further modeling or sculpting. Meta objects are also very efficient for ray tracing.

.. warning::

   Names of *Meta* objects are very important, as they define :ref:`families <meta-ball-object-families>`,
   and only objects within a same family interact with each other.
   Unlike other object types, even edition (transformations) in Object Mode will affect the generated geometry
   within the edited families.


Visualization
=============

In Object Mode, the calculated mesh is shown, along with a black "selection ring".

   Meta Ball in Edit mode.

In Edit Mode (Fig. :ref:`fig-meta-ball-example`), a meta is displayed as a mesh
(either shaded or as black wireframe, but without any vertex of course),
with two colored circles: a red one for selection (pink when selected),
and a green one for a direct control of the meta's stiffness (light green when active).
Note that except for the :ref:`scale transformation <bpy.ops.transform.resize>`,
having the green circle highlighted is equivalent to having the red one.
