The creation of a 3D scene needs at least three key components: Models, Materials and Lights.
In this part, the first of these is covered, that being modeling.
Modeling is simply the art and science of creating a surface that either mimics the shape
of a real-world object or expresses your imagination of abstract objects.


Modes
=====

Depending on the type of object you are trying to model, there are different types
of modeling :doc:`mode </editors/3dview/modes>`.
Since modes are not specific to modeling they are covered in different parts of the manual.

Switching between modes while modeling is common.
Some tools may be available in more than one mode while others may be unique to a particular mode.


Edit Mode
---------

Edit mode is the main mode where modeling takes place.
Edit mode is used to edit the following types of objects:

- Meshes
- Curves
- Surfaces
- Metaballs
- Text objects
- Lattice

You can only modify the mesh of the objects you are editing.
To modify other objects you can leave Edit Mode, select another object and enter Edit Mode,
or use :ref:`3dview-multi-object-mode`.
