Introduction

The creation of a 3D scene needs at least three key components: Models, Materials and Lights.
In this part, the first of these is covered, that being modeling.
Modeling is simply the art and science of creating a surface that either mimics the shape
of a real-world object or expresses your imagination of abstract objects.

Modeling can take many forms in Blender depending on the type of
:ref:`object <objects-types>` you are trying to model.
Some objects are not able to be modeled, these being:

- Speakers
- Cameras
- Lamps


Modes
=====

Depending on the type of object you are trying to model, there are different types
of modeling :doc:`mode </editors/3dview/modes>`.
Because modes are not specific to modeling they are covered in different parts of the manual.


Edit Mode
---------

Edit mode is the main mode that modeling takes place.
Edit mode is used to edit the following types of objects:

- Meshes
- Curves
- Surfaces
- Metaballs
- Text objects
- Lattice
