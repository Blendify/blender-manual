Mesh Modeling typically begins with
a :doc:`Mesh Primitive </modeling/meshes/primitives>` shape (e.g. circle, cube, cylinder...).
From there you might begin editing to create a larger, more complex shape.


Modeling Modes
==============

The 3D View has three principal modes that allow for the creation,
editing and manipulation of the mesh models.
Each of the three modes have a variety of tools. Some tools may be found in one or more of the modes.

Modes that used for modeling:

- Object Mode
- Edit Mode
- Sculpt Mode

Creation of a mesh primitive typically starts by adding a mesh object in *Object Mode*.
Limited types of editing such as size, location, and orientation can be accomplished in *Object Mode*.
*Object Mode* also provides the means to Join and Group multiple mesh primitives.
