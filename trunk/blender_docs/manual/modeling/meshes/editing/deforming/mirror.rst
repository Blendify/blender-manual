   | Mode:     Edit Mode
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Mesh --> Mirror --> Desired Axis`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`Ctrl-M`


The mirror tool mirrors a selection across a selected axis.

The mirror tool in *Edit Mode* is similar to
:doc:`Mirroring in Object Mode </modeling/meshes/editing/duplicating/mirror>`.
It is exactly equivalent to scaling by âˆ’1 vertices,
edges or faces around one chosen pivot point and in the direction of one chosen axis, only it is faster/handier.


After this tool becomes active, select an axis to mirror the selection on entering x,y, or z.

You can also interactively mirror the geometry by holding the :kbd:`MMB` and dragging in
the direction of the desired mirror direction.


Axis of symmetry
================

For each transformation orientation,
you can choose one of its axes along which the mirroring will occur.

As you can see, the possibilities are infinite and the freedom complete:
you can position the pivot point at any location around which we want the mirroring to occur,
choose one transformation orientation and then one axis on it.


Pivot point
===========

:doc:`Pivot points </editors/3dview/transform/transform_control/pivot_point/index>` must be set first.
Pivot points will become the center of symmetry.
If the widget is turned on it will always show where the pivot point is.


On Fig. Mirror around the Individual Centers ... the pivot point default to
median point of the selection of vertices in *Edit Mode*.
This is a special case of the *Edit Mode* as explained on the
:doc:`pivot point page </editors/3dview/transform/transform_control/pivot_point/index>`.

          Mesh after mirrored along X axis.


On Fig. Mirror around the 3D Cursor ... the pivot point is the *3D Cursor*,
the transformation orientation is *Local*, a.k.a. the Object space,
and the axis of transformation is X.

          Mesh before mirror.

     - .. figure:: /images/MirrorTool4.jpg
          :width: 300px

          Mesh after mirrored along X axis using the 3D cursor as a pivot point.


Transformation orientation
==========================

:doc:`Transformation Orientations </editors/3dview/transform/transform_control/transform_orientations>`
are found on the 3D area header, next to the *Widget* buttons.
They decide which coordinate system will rule the mirroring.
