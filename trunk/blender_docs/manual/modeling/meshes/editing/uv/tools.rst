:doc:`Grab </modeling/meshes/editing/uv/uv_sculpt>`
   The Grab brush moves UVs around.
:doc:`Relax </modeling/meshes/editing/uv/uv_sculpt>`
   The Relax brush makes UVs more evenly distributed.
   The algorithm relies on space, not stretch minimization,
   so most probably a minimize stretch will have to be run for optimal results.
   However it is great to use after stitching islands,
   or when unwrap produces cluttered results to smooth the distribution of UVs.

   Relaxation Method
      There are two relax algorithms:

      Laplacian, HC
:doc:`Pinch </modeling/meshes/editing/uv/uv_sculpt>`
   The Pinch brush moves UVs toward the brush's center.
   The pinch brush can be inverted by pressing :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB`.
