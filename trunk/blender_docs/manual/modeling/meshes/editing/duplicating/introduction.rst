This section covers mesh editing tools that add additional geometry by duplicating existing
geometry in some way.

.. note:: Multiple Viewports

   When you use one of the duplication tools in the *Mesh Tools* panel,
   Blender cannot guess which view you want to work in (if you have more than one opened, of course...)
   As the view is often important for these tools, once you have activated one,
   your cursor turns into a sort of question mark. Click with it inside the area you want to use.
