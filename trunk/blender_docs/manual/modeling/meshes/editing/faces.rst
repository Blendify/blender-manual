==============

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Edit Mode
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Mesh --> Faces --> Make Edge/Face`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`F`

This will create an edge or some faces, depending on your selection.
Also see :doc:`Creating Geometry </modeling/meshes/editing/basics/make_face_edge>`.

   | Mode:     Edit Mode
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Mesh --> Faces --> Fill/Beautify Fill`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`Alt-F`

The *Fill* option will create *triangular* faces from any group of selected edges
or vertices, as long as they form one or more complete perimeters.

Solidify
========

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Edit Mode
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Mesh --> Faces --> Solidify`

This takes a selection of faces and solidifies them by extruding them
uniformly to give volume to a :term:`non-manifold` surface.
This is also available as a :doc:`Modifier </modeling/modifiers/generate/solidify>`.
After using the tool, you can set the offset distance in the Operator Panel.

Thickness
   Amount to offset the newly created surface.
   Positive values offset the surface inward relative to the normals direction.
   Negative values offset outward.

.. list-table::

   * - .. figure:: /images/modeling_meshes_editing_faces_solidify-before.png
          :width: 200px

          Mesh before solidify operation.

     - .. figure:: /images/modeling_meshes_editing_faces_solidify-after.png
          :width: 200px

     - .. figure:: /images/modeling_meshes_editing_faces_solidify-after2.png
          :width: 200px

          Solidify with a negative thickness.


Intersect
=========

Intersect (Knife)
-----------------

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Edit Mode
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Mesh --> Faces --> Intersect (Knife)`

The Intersect tool lets you cut intersections into geometry.
It is a bit like Boolean Tool, but, does not calculate interior/exterior.
Faces are split along the intersections, leaving new edges selected.

Source
   Selected/Unselected
      Operate between the selected and unselected geometry.
   Self Intersect
      Operate on the overlapping geometry of the mesh.
Separate
   Splits the geometry at the new edge.
Merge Threshold
   *See Intersect (Boolean)*


Intersect (Boolean)
-------------------

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Edit Mode
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Mesh --> Faces --> Intersect (Boolean)`

Performs boolean operations with the selection on the unselected geometry.
While the :doc:`/modeling/modifiers/generate/booleans` is useful for non-destructive edits,
access to booleans as an edit-mode tool can be useful to quickly perform edits.

Boolean
   Difference, Union, Intersect
Swap
   Changes the order of the operation.
Merge Threshold
   Tolerance for close faces to be considered touching,
   It may be useful to increase this when some intersections aren't detected that should be and
   when extra geometry is being created because edges aren't detected as overlapping.

   .. warning::

      A threshold approaching size of faces may cause very slow calculation,
      in general keep this value small.


Wireframe
=========

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Edit Mode
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Mesh --> Faces --> Wire frame`

The wireframe tool makes a wireframe from faces by to turning edges into wireframe tubes,
similar to the :doc:`/modeling/modifiers/generate/wireframe`.


Poke Faces
==========

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Edit Mode
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Mesh --> Faces --> Poke Faces`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`Alt-P`

This tool fan-fills each face around a central vertex.
This can be useful as a way to triangulate n-gons, or the *Offset* can be used to make spikes or depressions.

Offset Relative
   ToDo.

Triangulate Faces
=================

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Edit Mode
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Mesh --> Faces --> Triangulate Faces`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`Ctrl-T`

As its name intimates, this tool converts each selected quadrangle into two triangles.
Remember that quads are just a set of two triangles.


.. _mesh-faces-tristoquads:

Triangles to Quads
==================

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Edit Mode
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Mesh --> Faces --> Triangles to Quads`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`Alt-J`

This tool converts the selected triangles into quads by taking adjacent tris and
removing the shared edge to create a quad, based on a threshold.
This tool can be applied on a selection of multiple triangles.

This same action can be done on a selection of two tris,
by selecting them and using the shortcut :kbd:`F`, to create a face, or by selecting the
shared edge and dissolving it with the shortcut :kbd:`X` :menuselection:`--> Dissolve`.

To create a quad, this tool needs at least two adjacent triangles.
If you have an even number of selected triangles,
it is also possible not to obtain only quads. In fact,
this tool tries to create "squarishest" quads as possible from the given triangles,
which means some triangles could remain.

.. list-table::

   * - .. figure:: /images/modeling_meshes_editing_faces_tris-to-quad-before.png
          :width: 320px

          Before converting tris to quads.

     - .. figure:: /images/modeling_meshes_editing_faces_tris-to-quad-after.png
          :width: 320px

          After converting tris to quads.

All the menu entries and hotkeys use the settings defined in the *Mesh Tools* panel:

Max Angle
   This value, between (0 to 180), controls the threshold for this tool to work on adjacent triangles.
   With a threshold of 0.0,
   it will only join adjacent triangles that form a perfect rectangle
   (i.e. right-angled triangles sharing their hypotenuses).
   Larger values are required for triangles with a shared edge that is small,
   relative to the size of the other edges of the triangles.
Compare UVs
   When enabled, it will prevent union of triangles that are not also adjacent in the active UV map.
Compare Vertex Color
   When enabled, it will prevent union of triangles that have no matching vertex color.
Compare Sharp
   When enabled, it will prevent union of triangles that share an edge marked as sharp.
Compare Materials
   When enabled, it will prevent union of triangles that do not have the same material assigned.


Weld Edges into Faces
=====================

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Edit Mode
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Mesh --> Faces --> Weld Edges into Faces`

A Tool to split selected faces by loose wire edges.
This can be used in a similar way to the knife tool, but the edges are manually setup first.


Rotate Edges
============

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Edit Mode
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Mesh --> Faces --> Rotate Edge CW`

This tool functions the same edge rotation in edge mode.

It works on the shared edge between two faces and rotates that edge if the edge was selected.

.. list-table::

   * - .. figure:: /images/modeling_meshes_editing_faces_rotate-edge-face-mode1.png
          :width: 320px

          Two Faces Selected.
