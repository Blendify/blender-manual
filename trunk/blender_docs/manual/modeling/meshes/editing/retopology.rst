Retopology
**********

Retopology is the process of simplifying the topology of a mesh to make it cleaner and easier to work with.
Retopology is need for mangled topology resulting from sculpting or generated topology, for example from a 3D scan.
Meshes often need to be retopologized if the mesh is going to be deformed in some way.
Deformations can include rigging or physics simulations such as cloth or soft body.
Retopology can be done by hand by manipulating geometry in Edit Mode or through automated methods.

Remeshing
=========

.. admonition:: Reference

Remeshing is a technique that automatically rebuilds the geometry with a more uniform topology.
Remeshing can either add or remove the amount of topology depending on a defined resolution.
This technique is especially useful for :doc:`sculpting </sculpt_paint/sculpting/index>`,
to generate better topology after blocking out the initial shape.

.. note::

   Remeshing only works on the original mesh data and ignores
   generated geometry from modifiers, shape keys, rigging ect.

Voxel
-----

The Voxel Remesher uses an OpenVDB to generate a new manifold mesh from the current geometry.
It produces a mesh with perfectly even distributed topology and
it does not have any performance penalty once the new mesh is calculated.
This makes the voxel remesher great for sculpting has it is possible to
sculpt at a much higher level of detail than using other features
like dyntopo which often adds more performance overhead.

Voxel Size
   The resolution or the amount of detail the remeshed mesh will have.
   The value is used to define the size, in object space, of the :term:`Voxel`.
   These voxels are assembled around the mesh and are used to determine the new geometry.
   For example a value of 0.5m will create topological patches that are about 0.5m
   (assuming *Preserve Volume* is enabled).
   Lower values preserve finer details but will result in a mesh with a much more dense topology.
