Sort Mesh Elements
==================

This tool (available from the *Specials*, *Vertices*,
*Edges* and *Faces* menus)
allows you to reorder the matching selected mesh elements, following various methods.
Note that when called from the *Specials* menu,
the affected element types are the same as the active select modes.

View Z Axis
   Sort along the active view's Z axis, from farthest to nearest by default
   (use *Reverse* if you want it the other way).

View X Axis
   Sort along the active view's X axis, from left to right by default (again, there is the *Reverse* option).

Cursor Distance
   Sort from nearest to farthest away from the 3D cursor position (*Reverse* also available).

Material
   **Faces only!** Sort faces from those having the lowest material's index to those having the highest.
   Order of faces inside each of those "material groups" remains unchanged.
   Note that the *Reverse* option only reverses the order of the materials,
   *not* the order of the faces inside them.

Selected
   Move all selected elements to the beginning (or end, if *Reverse* enabled),
   without affecting their relative orders.
   **Warning: this option will also affect unselected elements' indices!**

Randomize
   Randomizes indices of selected elements (*without* affecting those of unselected ones).
   The seed option allows you to get another randomization -
   the same seed over the same mesh/set of selected elements will always give the same result!

Reverse
   Simply reverse the order of the selected elements.


.. note:: To enable viewing indeces:

   Type "bpy.app.debug = True" into the Python Console and a checkbox will appear in the
   properties region under :menuselection:`Mesh Display --> Edge Info --> Indeces`


Join
====

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Object Mode
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Object --> Join`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`Ctrl-J`

Joining merges all objects into the last selected *Active* object.

This tools works for meshes, curves, surfaces, metas and armature object types.

.. note::

   Object data has many attributes which may be handled when joining.

   Materials, vertex-groups, UV and Vertex layers will be merged.

   Modifiers, constraints, groups and parent relationships
   are ignored when joining and will not be applied to the active object.


.. _object-separate:

Separate
========

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Edit Mode
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`Mesh --> Vertices --> Separate`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`P`

At some point, you will come to a time when you need to cut parts away from a mesh to be separate.

To separate an object, the vertices (or faces) must be selected and then separated,
though there are several different ways to do this.

   Suzanne dissected neatly.

Selected
   This option separates the selection to a new object.
All Loose Parts
   Separates the mesh in its unconnected parts.
By Material
   Creates separate mesh objects for each material.
