   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`K` or :kbd:`Shift-K`


The knife tool can be used to interactively cut up geometry by drawing lines or closed loops to create holes.


Usage
=====

When you press :kbd:`K` (or :kbd:`Shift-K`), the Knife tool becomes active.

Drawing the cut line
   When using *Knife*, the cursor changes to an icon of a scalpel
   and the header changes to display options for the tool.
   You can draw connected straight lines by clicking :kbd:`LMB`.

Options
=======


Knife selection :kbd:`Shift-K`
   Activates the knife so only selected faces are cut.

New cut :kbd:`E`
   Begins a new cut. This allows you to define multiple distinct cut lines.
   If multiple cuts have been defined, they are recognized as new snapping points.

          Result of starting new cuts while in the tool.


Midpoint snap :kbd:`Ctrl`
   Hold to snap the cursor to the midpoint of edges
Ignore snap :kbd:`Shift`
   Hold to make the tool ignore snapping.
Cut through: :kbd:`Z`
   Allow the cut tool to cut through to obscured faces, instead of only the visible ones.
Angle constrain :kbd:`C`
   Constrains the cut to 45 degree increments.
Close loop: Double click :kbd:`LMB`
   This is a quick way to close the loop you're currently cutting.
Draw a continuous line: :kbd:`LMB` drag.
   So you can draw a freehand line over a surface,
   points will be created at edge intersections.

Confirming and selection
========================

Pressing :kbd:`Esc` or :kbd:`RMB` at any time cancels the tool,
and pressing :kbd:`LMB` or :kbd:`Return` confirms the cut, with the following options:

:kbd:`Return` will leave selected every edge except the new edges created from the cut.


Limitations
===========

Cuts that begin or end in the middle of a face, will be ignored.
This is a limitation of the current geometry that can be modeled in Blender.


Knife Project
=============

Knife projection is a non-interactive tool where you can use objects to cookie-cut into the
mesh rather than hand drawing the line.

This works by using the outlines of other selected objects in edit-mode to cut into the mesh,
resulting geometry inside the cutters outline will be selected.

Outlines can be wire or boundary edges.

To use Knife Project,
in 'object' mode select the "cutting object" first then shift select the "object to be cut".
Now tab into edit mode and press "knife project".


Examples
--------

          Before projecting from a text object.

     - .. figure:: /images/Knife_project_text_after.jpg
          :width: 300px

          Resulting knife projection.

   * - .. figure:: /images/Knife_project_mesh_before.jpg
          :width: 300px

          Before projecting from a mesh object.

     - .. figure:: /images/Knife_project_mesh_after.jpg
          :width: 300px

          Resulting knife projection (extruded after).

   * - .. figure:: /images/Knife_project_curve_before.jpg
          :width: 300px

          Before projecting from a 3D curve object.

     - .. figure:: /images/Knife_project_curve_after.jpg
          :width: 300px

          Resulting knife projection (extruded after).


Known Issues
------------

Cutting holes into single faces may fail,
this is the same limitation as with the regular knife tool but more noticeable for text,
this can be avoided by projecting onto more highly subdivided geometry.
