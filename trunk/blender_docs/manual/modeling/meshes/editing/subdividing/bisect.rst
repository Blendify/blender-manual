The bisect tool is a quick way to cut a mesh in-two along a custom plane.

There are three important differences between this and the knife tool.


- The plane can be numerically adjusted in the operator panel for precise values.
- Cuts may remove geometry on one side.
- Cuts can optionally fill in the holes created,
  with materials and UV's & vertex-colors based on the surrounding geometry.

This means the bisect tool can cut off parts of a mesh without creating any holes.
