   Warp tool options.

In *Edit Mode*, the *Warp* transformation takes selected elements and
warps them around the 3D cursor by a certain angle.
Note that this transformation is always dependent on the location of the 3D cursor.
The Pivot Point is not taken into account.
The results of the *Warp* transformation are also view dependent.

In *Object Mode*, the *Warp* transformation takes the selected Objects and
causes them to move in an orbit-like fashion around the 3D cursor.
Similar to *Edit Mode*,
the Pivot Point is not taken into account and the results are view dependent.

.. (TODO remove): there is no Warp in Object Mode, maybe Bend?


Usage
=====

.. list-table:: In this example, a plane is warped around the 3D cursor by the indicated number of degrees.

   * - .. figure:: /images/modeling_meshes_editing_transform_warp_mesh.png
          :width: 320px

          Before.

     - .. figure:: /images/modeling_meshes_editing_transform_warp_mesh-90.png
          :width: 320px

          Warp Angle 90.

   * - .. figure:: /images/modeling_meshes_editing_transform_warp_mesh-180.png
          :width: 320px

          Warp Angle 180.

     - .. figure:: /images/modeling_meshes_editing_transform_warp_mesh-360.png
          :width: 320px

          Warp Angle 360.

Select the elements you want to operate on and activate the *Warp* transform tool.
The *Warp* tool can be invoked from
the :menuselection:`Object/Mesh/Curve/Surface --> Transform --> Warp` menu.
The amount of warping given to the selection can be determined
interactively by moving the mouse or by typing a number. Pressing :kbd:`Enter`
will confirm the transformation. The confirmed transformation can
be further edited by pressing :kbd:`F6` or by going into the Tool Shelf
and altering the Angle slider provided that no other actions take place between
the *Warp* transform confirmation and accessing the slider.


Cursor Position and View
------------------------

The location of the 3D cursor can be used to alter the results of the *Warp* transformation.
As can be seen from the example in this section, the *Warp* radius
is dependent on the distance of the cursor from the selected elements.
The greater the distance, the greater the radius.

The result of the *Warp* transform is also influenced by your current view.
The example in this section shows the results of a 180 degree *Warp* transform applied
to the same Plane mesh when in different views.

.. list-table:: This image shows how the Warp transform is influenced by the location of the cursor.

          :width: 320px

          Warp Angle 180 in X-Z view.

   * - .. figure:: /images/modeling_meshes_editing_transform_warp_view-3.png
          :width: 320px

          Warp Angle 180 in Y-Z view.

          :width: 320px

          Warp Angle 180 in User view.

.. note:: Warping text

   If you want to warp text, you will need to convert it from a Text Object to Mesh
   by pressing :kbd:`Alt-C` and selecting the *Mesh from Curve/Meta/Surf/Text* option.


Example
=======

.. figure:: /images/modeling_meshes_editing_transform_warp_text.jpg

   Text wrapped around logo.

This was made by creating the Blender logo and text as separate Objects.
The text was converted to a mesh and then warped around the Blender logo.
