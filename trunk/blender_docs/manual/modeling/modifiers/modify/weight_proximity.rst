   The Vertex Weight Proximity Modifier panel.


This modifier sets the weights of the given vertex group,
based on the distance between the object (or its vertices),
and another target object (or its geometry).

.. warning::

   This modifier does implicit clamping of weight values in the standard (0.0 to 1.0) range.
   All values below 0.0 will be set to 0.0, and all values above 1.0 will be set to 1.0.


Options
=======

Vertex Group
   The vertex group to affect.

Target Object
   The object from which to compute distances.

Proximity mode
   Object Distance
      Use the distance between the modified mesh object and the target object as
      weight for all vertices in the affected vertex group.
   Geometry Distance
      Use the distance between each vertex and the target object, or its geometry.

      Vertex
         This will set each vertex's weight from its distance to the nearest vertex of the target object.
      Edge
         This will set each vertex's weight from its distance to the nearest edge of the target object.
      Face
         This will set each vertex's weight from its distance to the nearest face of the target object.

      .. note::

         If you enable more than one of them, the shortest distance will be used.
         If the target object has no geometry (e.g. an empty or camera),
         it will use the location of the object itself.

Lowest
   Distance mapping to 0.0 weight.
Highest
   Distance mapping to 1.0 weight.

.. tip::

   *Lowest* can be set above *Highest* to reverse the mapping.


Falloff Type
   Type of mapping:

   Linear
      No mapping.
   Custom Curve
      Allows the user to manually define the mapping using a curve.
   Sharp, Smooth, Root and Sphere
      These are classical mapping functions, from spikiest to roundest.
   Random
      Uses a random value for each vertex.
   Median Step
      Creates binary weights (0.0 or 1.0), with 0.5 as cutting value.


Influence/Mask Options
----------------------

Global Influence
   The overall influence of the modifier
   (0.0 will leave the vertex group's weights untouched, 1.0 is standard influence).

   .. warning::

      Influence only affects weights, adding/removing of vertices
      to/from vertex group is not prevented by setting this value to 0.0.


Vertex Group Mask
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Vertex Group Mask
   An additional vertex group, the weights of which will be
   multiplied with the global influence value for each vertex.
   If a vertex is not in the masking vertex group, its weight will be not be affected.


Texture Mask
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Texture Mask
   An additional texture, the values of which will be multiplied with the global influence value for each vertex.

   This is a standard texture :doc:`data-block </data_system/data_blocks>` control.
   When set, it reveals other settings:

Texture Coordinates
   How the texture is mapped to the mesh.

   Local
      Use local vertex coordinates.
   Global
      Use vertex coordinates in global space.
   Object
      Use vertex coordinates in another object's space.

      Object
         The object to be used as reference for *Object* mapping.
   UV
      Use a UV map's coordinates.

      UV Map
         The UV map to be used for *UV* mapping.

Use Channel
   Which channel to use as weight factor source.

   Red/Green/Blue/Alpha
      One of the color channels' values.
   Intensity
      The average of the RGB channels (if RGB(1.0, 0.0, 0.0) value is 0.33).
   Value
      The highest value of the RGB channels (if RGB(1.0, 0.0, 0.0) value is 1.0).
   Hue
      Uses the hue value from the standard color wheel (e.g. blue has a higher hue value than yellow).
   Saturation
      Uses the saturation value (e.g. pure red's value is 1.0, gray is 0.0).

   .. note::

      All of the channels above are gamma corrected, except for *Intensity*.


.. note::

   You can view the modified weights in *Weight Paint Mode*.
   This also implies that you will have to disable the *Vertex Weight Proximity Modifier*
   if you want to see the original weights of the vertex group you are editing.


Example
=======

.. rubric:: Using Distance from a Target Object

In this example let us dynamically control a Wave Modifier with a modified vertex group:

#. Add a *Grid* mesh with (100Ã—100) x/y subdivisions and a 5 BU Radius.
#. Switch to *Edit Mode* :kbd:`Tab`, and in the *Object Data* properties, *Vertex Groups* panel,
   add a vertex group. Assign to it all your mesh's vertices with 1.0 weight.
#. Go back to *Object Mode*. Then, go to the *Modifiers* properties, and add a Vertex Weight Proximity Modifier.
   Set the Distance mode to *Object*. Select your vertex group, and the target object you want.

   You will likely have to adjust the linear mapping of the weights produced by the
   Vertex Weight Proximity Modifier. To do so, edit *Lowest Distance* and
   *Highest Distance* so that the first corresponds to the distance between your target
   object and the vertices you want to have lowest weight,
   and similarly with the second and highest weight...
#. If your lamp is at Z-hight of 2 then set the settings for the Weight Proximity Modifier to:
   Lowest: 2 and highest: 7 (this will stop the waves under the lamp)
   If you want waves to be only under the lamp, set the lowest to 7 and highest to 2.
#. Now add a Wave Modifier, set it to your liking, and use the same vertex group to control it.
   Example settings-speed: 0.10 , Height: 1.0 , Width 1.50 , Narrowness: 1.50.
#. Animate your target object, making it move over the grid. As you can see, the waves are only
   visible around the reference object! Note that you can insert a *Vertex Weight Edit*
   modifier before the *Wave* one,
   and use its *Custom Curve* mapping to get larger/narrower "wave influence's slopes".
