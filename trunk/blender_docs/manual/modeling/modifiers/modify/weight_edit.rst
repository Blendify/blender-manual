Vertex Weight Edit Modifier

   The Vertex Weight Edit modifier panel.

This modifier is intended to edit the weights of one vertex group.

The general process is the following, for each vertex:

- (Optional) It does the mapping, either through one of the predefined functions, or a custom mapping curve.
- It applies the influence factor, and optionally the vertex group or texture mask
  (0.0 means original weight, 1.0 means fully mapped weight).
- It applies back the weight to the vertex, and/or it might optionally remove the vertex
  from the group if its weight is below a given threshold, or add it if it's above a given threshold.

.. warning::

   This modifier does implicit clamping of weight values in the standard (0.0 to 1.0) range.
   All values below 0.0 will be set to 0.0, and all values above 1.0 will be set to 1.0.


Options
=======

Vertex Group
   The vertex group to affect.

Default Weight
   The default weight to assign to all vertices not in the given vertex group.

Group Add
   Adds vertices with a final weight over *Add Threshold* to the vertex group.

Group Remove
   Removes vertices with a final weight below *Remove Threshold* from the vertex group.

Falloff Type
   Type of mapping:

   Linear
      No mapping.
   Custom Curve
      Allows the user to manually define the mapping using a curve.
   Sharp, Smooth, Root and Sphere
      These are classical mapping functions, from spikiest to roundest.
   Random
      Uses a random value for each vertex.
   Median Step
      Creates binary weights (0.0 or 1.0), with 0.5 as cutting value.

Global Influence
   The overall influence of the modifier
   (0.0 will leave the vertex group's weights untouched, 1.0 is standard influence).

   .. warning::

      Influence only affects weights, adding/removing of vertices
      to/from vertex group is not prevented by setting this value to 0.0.

Vertex Group Mask
   An additional vertex group, the weights of which will be
   multiplied with the global influence value for each vertex.
   If a vertex is not in the masking vertex group, its weight will be not be affected.

Texture Mask
   An additional texture, the values of which will be multiplied with the global influence value for each vertex.

   This is a standard texture :doc:`data-block </data_system/data_blocks>` control.
   When set, it reveals other settings:

   Texture Coordinates
      How the texture is mapped to the mesh.

      Local
         Use local vertex coordinates.
      Global
         Use vertex coordinates in global space.
      Object
         Use vertex coordinates in another object's space.

         Object
            The object to be used as reference for *Object* mapping.
      UV
         Use a UV layer's coordinates.

         UV Layer
            The UV layer to be used for *UV* mapping.

   Use Channel
      Which channel to use as weight factor source/

      Red/Green/Blue/Alpha
         One of the color channels' values.
      Intensity
         The average of the RGB channels (if RGB(1.0, 0.0, 0.0) value is 0.33)
      Value
         The highest value of the RGB channels (if RGB(1.0, 0.0, 0.0) value is 1.0)
      Hue
         Uses the hue value from the standard color wheel (e.g. blue has a higher hue value than yellow)
      Saturation
         Uses the saturation value (e.g. pure red's value is 1.0, gray is 0.0)

      .. note::

         All of the channels above are gamma corrected, except for *Intensity*.

.. note::

   You can view the modified weights in *Weight Paint Mode*.
   This also implies that you will have to disable the *Vertex Weight Edit Modifier*
   if you want to see the original weights of the vertex group you are editing.


Example
=======

.. rubric:: Using Distance from a Target Object's Geometry

We're going to illustrate this with a *Displace* modifier.

Add a (10×10 BU) 100×100 vertices grid, and in *Edit Mode*,
add to it a vertex group containing all of its vertices, as above.
You can even further sub-divide it with a first *Subsurf* modifier.

Now add a curve circle, and place it 0.25 BU above the grid. Scale it up a bit (e.g. 4.0 BU).

Back to the grid object, add to it a *Vertex Weight Proximity* modifier,
in *Geometry Distance* mode. Enable *Edge*
(if you use *Vertex* only, and your curve has a low U definition,
you would get wavy patterns, see Fig. :ref:`fig-modifier-vertex-weight-wavy`).

.. _fig-modifier-vertex-weight-wavy:

.. list-table:: Wavy patterns.

   * - .. figure:: /images/modifiersweightvgroupgeometryex1-0pf.jpg

          Distance from edges.

     - .. figure:: /images/modifiersweightvgroupgeometryex1-0pfwavyweights.jpg
          :width: 320px

          Distance from vertices.


Set the *Lowest Dist* to 0.2, and the *Highest Dist* to 2.0,
to map back the computed distances into the regular weight range.

Add a third *Displace* modifier and affect it the texture you like. Now,
we want the vertices of the grid nearest to the curve circle to remain undisplaced.
As they will get weights near zero, this means that you have to set the *Midlevel*
of the displace to 0.0. Make it use our affected vertex group,
and that is it! Your nice mountains just shrink to a flat plane near the curve circle.

As in the previous example,
you can insert a *Vertex Weight Edit* modifier before the *Displace* one,
and play with the *Custom Curve* mapping to get a larger/narrower "valley"...

   *Curve Map* variations.

   :width: 200px

   Vertices with a computed weight below 0.1 removed from the vertex group.


You can also add a fifth *Mask* modifier, and enable *Vertex Weight Edit* 's *Group Remove* option,
with a *Remove Threshold* of 0.1, to see the bottom of your valley disappear.
