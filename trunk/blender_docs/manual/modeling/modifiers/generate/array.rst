Array Modifier
**************

The Array Modifier creates an array of copies of the base object, with each copy being offset from the previous
one in any of a number of possible ways. Vertices in adjacent copies can be merged if they are nearby,
allowing smooth :doc:`Subdivision Surface </modeling/modifiers/generate/subsurf>` frameworks to be generated.

This modifier can be useful when combined with tileable meshes for quickly developing large
scenes. It is also useful for creating complex repetitive shapes.

Multiple Array Modifiers may be active for an object at the same time
(e.g. to create complex three dimensional constructs).


Options
=======

   :align: right

   Array Modifier.


Fit Type
   Controls how the length of the array is determined. There are three choices, activating respectively the
   display of the *Curve*, *Length* or *Count* settings explained below:

   Fit Curve
      Generates enough copies to fit within the length of the curve object specified in *Curve*.
   Fit Length
      Generates enough copies to fit within the fixed length given by *Length*.
   Fixed Count
      Generates the number of copies specified in *Count*.

.. note::

   - Both *Fit Curve* and *Fit Length* use the local coordinate system size of the base object, which means that
     scaling the base object in *Object Mode* will not change the number of copies generated by the Array Modifier.
   - *Fit Length* uses the local coordinate system length of the curve, which means that scaling the curve in
     *Object Mode* will not change the number of copies generated by the Array Modifier.
   - Applying the scale with :kbd:`Ctrl-A` can be useful for each one.


Offset
------

Constant Offset, X, Y, Z
   Adds a constant translation component to the duplicate object's offset.
   X, Y and Z constant components can be specified.

Relative Offset, X, Y, Z
   Adds a translation equal to the object's bounding box size along each axis, multiplied by a scaling factor,
   to the offset. X, Y and Z scaling factors can be specified.

   .. figure:: /images/modeling_modifiers_generate_array_offset-relative.png

      Relative offset (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5) examples.

Object Offset
   Adds a transformation taken from an object (relative to the current object) to the offset.
   It is good practice to use an Empty object centered or near to the initial object.
   E.g. by rotating this Empty a circle or helix of objects can be created.

      Object offset example.

Merge
-----

Merge
   If enabled, vertices in each copy will be merged with vertices
   in the next copy that are within the given *Distance*.
First Last
   If enabled **and** *Merge* is enabled, vertices in the first copy will be merged with vertices
   in the last copy (this is useful for circular objects).

   .. list-table:: First Last merge example.

      * - .. figure:: /images/modeling_modifiers_generate_array_first-last-off.png

            Subdivision discontinuity caused by not merging vertices between first and last copies (*First Last* off).

        - .. figure:: /images/modeling_modifiers_generate_array_first-last-on.png

            Subdivision discontinuity eliminated by merging vertices between first and last copies (*First Last* on).

Distance
   Controls the merge distance for *Merge*.


Cap
---

Start Cap / End Cap
   This allows either endpoints of the array to have a different mesh subsisted.

   For the *start*: as if it was in position -1, i.e. one "array step" before the first "regular" array copy.
   For the *end*: as if it was in position *n* + 1, i.e. one "array step" after the last "regular" array copy.

   When *Merge* is activated, and the *cap* vertices are within the distance threshold, they will be merged.

   .. note::

      The start/end cap objects currently do not support the *First Last* option.


Hints
=====

Offset Calculation
------------------

The transformation applied from one copy to the next is calculated as the sum of the three
different components (*Relative*, *Constant* and *Object*),
each of which can be enabled/disabled independently of the others. This allows, for example,
a relative offset of (1.0, 0.0, 0.0) and a constant offset of (0.1, 0.0, 0.0),
giving an array of objects neatly spaced along the X axis with a constant 0.1
unit between them, whatever the original object's size.

It is for an old Blender Version (2.44) but except for the keyboard
shortcuts it is still valid.
