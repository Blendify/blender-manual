Build Modifier
**************

The Build modifier causes the faces of the mesh object to appear one after the other over time.

By default, faces appear in the order in which they are stored in memory (by default, the order of creation).
The face/vertex order can be altered in Edit Mode by selecting
:doc:`Sort Mesh Elements </modeling/meshes/editing/misc>` from the *Search Menu* :kbd:`Spacebar`

.. note::

   When using Blender Render, if the material of the mesh is a halo rather than a standard one,
   then the vertices of the mesh, not the faces, appear one after another.

   Build modifier in action.


Start
   The start frame of the building process.

Length
   The number of frames over which to rebuild the object.

Randomize
   Randomizes the order in which the faces are built.

Seed
   The random seed.
   Changing this value gives a different "random" order when *"Randomize"* is checked --
   this order is always the same for a given seed/object set.
