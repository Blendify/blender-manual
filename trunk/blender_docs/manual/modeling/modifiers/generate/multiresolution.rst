************************
Multiresolution Modifier
************************

The *Multiresolution* modifier (often shortened to "Multires") gives you the ability to subdivide a mesh similarly
to the :doc:`Subdivision Surface </modeling/modifiers/generate/subdivision_surface>` modifier,
but also allows you to edit the new subdivision levels in :doc:`Sculpt Mode </sculpt_paint/sculpting/introduction>`.

.. note::

   *Multiresolution* is the only modifier that cannot be repositioned in the stack after any modifier that will
   change geometry or other object data (i.e. all *Generate*, some *Modify* and some *Simulate* modifiers
   cannot come before the *Multiresolution* one).


Options
=======

.. figure:: /images/modeling_modifiers_generate_multiresolution_panel.png
   :align: right

   The Multiresolution modifier.

Type
   Sets the type of subdivision.

   Simple
      Maintains the current shape, and simply subdivides edges.
   Catmull-Clark
      Creates a smooth surface, usually smaller than the original, using the standard
      `Catmull-Clark <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catmull%E2%80%93Clark_subdivision_surface>`__
      subdivision surface algorithm.


Levels
------

The left column of settings control the general quality generated by the modifier in various contexts.

Preview
   Set the level of subdivisions to show in Object Mode.
Sculpt
   Set the level of subdivisions to use in Sculpt Mode.
Render
   Set the level of subdivisions to show when rendering.
Quality
   How precisely the vertices are positioned (relatively to their theoretical position),
   can be lowered to get a better performance when working on heavy meshes.


Operations
----------

The right column gathers several operators necessary to manage multi-resolution workflow.

Subdivide
   Adds another level of subdivision.
Delete Higher
   Deletes all subdivision levels that are higher than the current one.
Reshape
   Copies vertex coordinates from another mesh.

   To use it, first select a different mesh object with matching topology and vertex indices,
   then :kbd:`Shift` select the object you wish to copy vertex coordinates to, and click *Reshape*.

Apply Base
   Modifies the original unsubdivided mesh to match the form of the subdivided mesh.


Further Options
---------------

UV Smooth
   How to handle UVs during subdivision.

   Smooth, keep corners
      UV islands are smoothed, but their boundary remain sharp.
   Sharp
      UV remain unchanged.

Subdivide UVs
   When enabled, the UV maps will also be subdivided.
   (I.e. Blender will add "virtual" coordinates for all sub-faces created by this modifier.)
Optimal Display
   When rendering the wireframe of this object, the wires of the new subdivided edges will be skipped
   (only displays the edges of the original geometry).

Save External
   Saves displacements to an external ``.btx`` file.
