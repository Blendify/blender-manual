*******************
Shrinkwrap Modifier
*******************

The *Shrinkwrap* Modifier allows an object to "shrink" to the surface of another
object. It moves each vertex of the object being modified to the closest position on the
surface of the given mesh (using one of the three methods available).

It can be applied to meshes, lattices, curves, surfaces and texts.


Options
=======

.. figure:: /images/modeling_modifiers_deform_shrinkwrap_nearest-surface-point.jpg

   Nearest Surface Point.

Target
   Shrink target, the mesh to shrink to/wrap around.
Offset
   The distance that must be kept from the calculated target position, in Blender Units.

Vertex Group
   The vertex group to control whether and how much each vertex is displaced to its target position.
   If a vertex is not a member of this group, it is not displaced (same as weight 0).


Mode
----

This selector specifies the method to be used to determine the nearest point on the target's surface
for each vertex of the modified object. Some options will add some extra, specific controls to the panel.


Nearest Surface Point
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This will select the nearest point over the surface of the shrink target.
It adds the extra option *Above surface*,
which always keep the computed vertices above their "floor faces".
This is only meaningful when *Offset* is not null.


Projection
^^^^^^^^^^

This will project vertices along a chosen axis until they touch the shrink target.
Vertices that never touch the shrink target are left in their original position.

   Projection options.

Subdivision Surface Levels
   This applies a (temporary) *Catmull-Clark* subdivision to the modified object,
   before computing the wrap when using Projection mode.
Limit
   This is a distance limit between original vertex and surface.
   If the distance is larger than this limit vertex would not be projected onto the surface,
Axis
   Along which local axis of the modified object the projection is done.
   These options can be combined with each other, yielding a "median axis" of projection.

   X, Y, Z
Direction
   This allows you to select the allowed direction(s) of the shrink along the selected axis.
   With more than one Shrinkwrap Modifier, negative and positive axes can be combined.

   Negative, Positive
Cull Faces
   This radio button allows you to prevent any projection over the "front side"
   (respectively the "back side") of the target's faces. The "side" of a face is determined
   by its normal (front being the side "from where" the normal "originates").
Auxiliary Target
   An additional object to project over.


Nearest Vertex
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This will snap vertices to the nearest vertex of the shrink target. It adds no extra options.
