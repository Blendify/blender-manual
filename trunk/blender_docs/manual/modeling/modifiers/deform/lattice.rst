Lattice Modifier
****************

The *Lattice* modifier deforms the base object according to
the shape of a :doc:`Lattice </animation/lattice>` object.
Objects to be deformed can be meshes, curves,
surfaces, text, lattices and even particles.

.. tip::

   A *Lattice* modifier can quickly be added to selected objects by
   :ref:`parenting <bpy.ops.object.parent_set>` them using the *Lattice Deform* option.

   The Lattice modifier.

Object
   The :doc:`Lattice </animation/lattice>` object with which to deform the base object.
Vertex Group
   An optional vertex group name which lets you limit the modifier's effect to a part of the base mesh.
Strength
   A factor to control blending between original and deformed vertex positions.


Hints
=====

Why would you use a lattice to deform a mesh instead of deforming the mesh itself in Edit Mode?
There are a couple of reasons for that:

- If your object has a large number of vertices, it would be difficult to edit portions of it quickly in Edit Mode.
  Using a lattice will allow you to deform large portions efficiently.
- The smooth deformation you get from a *Lattice* modifier can be hard to achieve manually.
- Multiple objects can use the same lattice, thus allowing you to edit multiple objects at once.
- Like all modifiers, it is non-destructive. Meaning all changes happen on top of the original geometry,
  which you can still go back to and edit without affecting the deformation.
- A lattice does not affect the texture coordinates of a mesh's surface.

.. note::

   When using a lattice to deform particles, order in the :ref:`modifier stack <modifier-stack>` matters.
   You need to place the *Lattice* modifier after the *Particle System* one.
