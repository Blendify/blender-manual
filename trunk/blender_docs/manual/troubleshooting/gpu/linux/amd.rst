On Linux, graphics drivers are usually installed as a package by your Linux
distribution. Installing the latest drivers is typically done by upgrading packages
or the distribution as a whole. Some distributions provide multiple packages
for multiple drivers versions, giving you the choice to install newer versions.

AMD drivers are open source, except for the OpenCL support which is available as
part of Pro drivers. Installing packages through your Linux distribution is
usually best. AMD also provides graphics drivers for download on their website
if you need the latest version.
