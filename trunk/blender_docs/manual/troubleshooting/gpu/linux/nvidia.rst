On Linux, graphics drivers are usually installed as a package by your Linux
distribution. Installing the latest drivers is typically done by upgrading
packages or the distribution as a whole. Some distributions provide multiple
packages for multiple drivers versions, giving you the choice to install newer
versions.

For NVIDIA there are open source (Nouveau) and closed source (by NVIDIA)
graphics drivers. Blender functions best with the closed source drivers as they
are more optimized and complete. Linux graphics drivers can be downloaded from
NVIDIAâ€™s website, however in most cases the ones from your Linux distribution
are fine and make things easier. Manually downloading drivers is mostly useful
to get the very latest version, for example for a GPU that was only recently
released.
