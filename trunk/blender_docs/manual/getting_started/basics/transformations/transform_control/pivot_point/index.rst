   Pivot Point modes.


The pivot point is the point in space around which all rotations,
scalings and mirror transformations are centered. You can choose one of five *Pivot Points*
from a drop-down list in the header of any 3D area, as seen here in
(*Pivot Point modes*).
The pages linked below describe each *Pivot Point* mode in more detail.

Note that even if the above examples use meshes, the same rules apply for other types (curves,
surfaces...) as well.
