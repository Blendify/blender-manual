   | Mode:     All modes
   | Menu:     :menuselection:`View --> Local View` or :menuselection:`View --> Global View`
   | Hotkey:   :kbd:`NumpadSlash`


Description
===========

When in *Local* view, only the selected objects are displayed,
which can make editing easier in complex scenes. To enter local view,
first select the objects you want, and then use the :menuselection:`View --> Local View` menu entry.
Use the :menuselection:`View --> Global View` menu entry to go back to global view.
:kbd:`NumpadSlash` toggles between both views.

Note that the layer and lock buttons on the *3D View* header disappear while in
local view.


Examples
========

In *Global view*, all the objects are visible. With the green cube selected,
switching to *Local view* with :kbd:`NumpadSlash` will center the cube in the *3D View*.
If a scene has thousands of objects visible, this feature can potentially speed interactivity
up because only the objects you selected will be visible.
