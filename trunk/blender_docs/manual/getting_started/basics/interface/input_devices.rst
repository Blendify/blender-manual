Input Devices
*************

Blender supports various types of input devices:

- Keyboard (recommended: keyboard with numeric keypad, english layout works best)
- Mouse (recommended: 3 button mouse with scroll wheel)
- NDOF Devices (Space Navigator, etc.)
- Graphic Tablets

Usage of Mouse Buttons
======================

In Blender the :kbd:`RMB` (Right Mouse Button) is generally used for Selection
and the :kbd:`LMB` (Left Mouse Button) initiates or confirms actions. 

Exceptions from the rule
------------------------

Unfortunately there are a few corner cases where action and selection 
might intertwine. And some parts in Blender even violate the principle 
such that now :kbd:`LMB` selects and :kbd:`RMB` takes action (example: the Outliner).

The mouse usage summarized:

     - To select an item
   * - :kbd:`SHIFT` :kbd:`RMB`
     - To add more items
   * - :kbd:`LMB`
     - to perform an action on the selection

Non English Keyboard
====================

If you use a keyboard with a non-english keyboard layout, you still may benefit from switching
your computer to the UK or US layout as long as you work with Blender.
Note that you can also change the Blender default keymap and change the default hotkeys.
However this manual is based on the default keymap.
