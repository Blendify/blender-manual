Input Devices
*************

Blender supports various types of input devices:

- Keyboard (recommended: keyboard with numeric keypad, english layout works best)
- Mouse (recommended: 3 button mouse with scroll wheel)
- NDOF Devices
- Graphic Tablets


Usage of Mouse Buttons
======================

In Blender the :kbd:`RMB` (Right Mouse Button) is generally used for Selection
and the :kbd:`LMB` (Left Mouse Button) initiates or confirms actions. 

The mouse usage summarized:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 85

   * - :kbd:`RMB`
     - To select an item
   * - :kbd:`Shift-RMB`
     - To add more items to the selection
   * - :kbd:`LMB`
     - to perform an action on the selection

Exceptions from the Rule
------------------------

Unfortunately there are a few corner cases where action and selection 
might intertwine. Some parts in Blender even violate the principle 
such that :kbd:`LMB` selects and :kbd:`RMB` takes action, for example, the :doc:`Outliner </editors/outliner>`.


Non English Keyboard
====================

If you use a keyboard with a non-english keyboard layout, you still may benefit from switching
your computer to the UK or US layout as long as you work with Blender.

Note that you can also change the default keymap and default hotkeys from the
:doc:`User Preferences </preferences/input>`, however this manual assumes you are using the default keymap.
