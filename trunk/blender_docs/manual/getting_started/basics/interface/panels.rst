Panels
******

Panels are collapsible sections within Regions to have their elements
more organized. They are heavily used in the *Properties Editor* but also
appear elsewhere, e.g. in the Tool Shelf or the Properties Shelf that are
available in some Editors.

The image below shows Panels in different Regions in their expanded and
collapsed state.

   Expanded (1) and collapsed (2) Panels in the Properties Editor (right area)
   and in the additional Regions of the 3D View Editor (left area)

- A click with the :kbd:`LMB` on the title area of a Panel expands or collapses it.
- A :kbd:`LMB` drag motion over the title area will expand or collapse many at once.
- A :kbd:`Ctrl+LMB` click on the title area of a specific Panel will collapse
  all other Panels and make this the only expanded one.

The availability of Panels in certain Regions can change related to the
active Context. So for instance the Tool Shelf will show different Panels
when used in different Editors. Also, the Panels in the Properties Editor
will change if you switch its Context with the buttons in the Header.

There are some options available to customize Panels to your preference:

- You can change the position of a Panel within its Region by clicking and
  dragging it with the :kbd:`LBM` on the little widget in the upper right corner.
- The zoom factor of a whole Region with Panels can be changed by
  :kbd:`Ctrl+MMB` clicking and moving the mouse anywhere within that Region
- The alignment of the Panels in the Properties Editor can be changed
  between vertical and horizontal. To do this click with :kbd:`RMB` somewhere
  within the main Region of the Properties Editor and choose either
  *Horizontal* or *Vertical* from the appearing menu. Keep in mind though that
  the Panels are optimized for vertical alignment.

For further details about each Panel find the appropriate section for the
related Editor in the manual.
