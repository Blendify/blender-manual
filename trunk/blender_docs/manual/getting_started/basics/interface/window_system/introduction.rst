*****************
The Window System
*****************

When you start Blender you should see a screen similar to this
(the splash screen in the center will change with new versions):

   Initial Blender screen


In the center of the window is the splash screen.
This gives quick and easy access to recently opened Blender files.
If you want to start work on a new file just click outside of the splash screen.
The splash screen will disappear revealing the default layout and cube.

Every window you see can be further broken down into separate areas
(as described in the section on
:doc:`arranging frames </getting_started/basics/interface/window_system/arranging_frames>`).
The default scene is described below.


The default scene
=================

The default scene is separated into five windows and is loaded each time you start Blender or
a new file. The five windows are:

- The Info window (shaded red) at the top. The Info window is comprised solely of a header.
- A large 3D window (3D View) (shaded green).
- A Timeline window at the bottom (shaded purple).
- An Outliner window at the top right (shaded yellow).
- A Properties window (Buttons window) at the bottom right (shaded blue).

As an introduction we will cover a few of the basic elements.
