If you are familiar with other 3D software you will immediately
notice that Blender is quite different from what you are used to seeing.
However you will soon see similarities with your previous software,
like a *3D Viewport*, an *Outliner* and a *Timeline*.
If this is the first time you have used any 3D software, you may be a little lost.
Fortunately there's really only one rule when you want to learn 3D with Blender:
don't be afraid to explore and experiment!

After starting Blender, take a look at the splash screen where you will see the Blender
version in the top right-hand corner.

The left side shows you some useful links like the
`release log <http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Dev:Ref/Release_Notes/changelog_258/>`__
of the version you are using (what's new in this version), the wiki manual (what you're reading now) and the
`official Blender website <http://www.blender.org>`__.
These links are also accessible from the *Help* menu.

The right side lists recent blender files (.blend) you have saved.
If you're running Blender for the first time, this part will be empty.
This list is also available in :menuselection:`File --> Open Recent`.
The interaction menu lets you choose a keymap preset
(by default, *Blender* or *Maya*) are available.

To start using Blender, you have three options:

- Click on one of the recent files (if you have any)
- Click anywhere else on the screen (except the dark area of the splash screen) or
- Press :kbd:`Esc` to start a new project


Save your work regularly
========================

Blender does not warn you of any unsaved data when you exit the program,
so remember to save often! If you do close Blender without saving your last actions,
all is not lost.
Just open Blender again and click on *Recover Last Session* in the Splash Screen.
You also have this option in the main menu via :menuselection:`File --> Recover Last Session`.


.. note:: Temporary ``.blend`` file

   Every time Blender exits, it saves the current data in a temporary ``.blend`` file.
   When you recover your last session, Blender will load the data from that file.


Interface concepts
==================

.. figure:: /images/Blender-cross-platform.jpg
   :align: right
   :width: 250


Blender is developed as cross-platform software which means that its primary target is to work
seamlessly in all major operating systems, including Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.
:sup:`(1)`

Since the Blender interface is based on OpenGL,
you will find that it is consistent between the major operating systems.

:sup:`(1)` Other operating systems are supported by third party developers through source compilation.


The 3 Rules
===========

The Blender user interface is based on 3 main principles:


Non Overlapping
   The UI permits you to view all relevant options and tools at a glance
   without pushing or dragging windows around\ :sup:`(2)`.
Non Blocking
   Tools and interface options do not block the user from any other parts of Blender.
   Blender doesn't pop up requesters that require the user to fill in data before things execute.
Non Modal
   User input should remain as consistent and predictable as possible
   without changing commonly used methods (mouse, keyboard) on the fly.

:sup:`(2)` However, Blender 2.5 permits multiple windows for multi-screen setup.
It is an exception to the *Non overlapping rule*.


Powerful interface
==================

.. figure:: /images/Opengl.jpg
   :align: right

Blender's interface is drawn entirely in `OpenGL <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL>`__
which allows you to customize your interface to suit your needs.
Windows and other interface elements can be panned, zoomed and their content moved around.
Your screen can be organized exactly to your taste for each specialized task which can then be
named and saved.

Blender also makes heavy use of keyboard shortcuts to speed up your work.
The keymaps can be edited to make memorizing them easier.


Overview
========

Let's have a look at the default interface. It is composed of Editors, Headers,
Context buttons, Regions, Panels and Controls.


Editor
   In Blender, we call an **Editor** the parts of the software which have a specific function
   (3D view, Properties Editor, Video Sequence Editor, Nodes Editor...).
   Each editor has its own *Header* at the top or bottom.
Context buttons
   give access to options.
   They are like tabs and are often placed on an editor header (like Properties Editor).
Panels
   For each editor, options are grouped in *Panels* to logically organize the interface
   (Shadow panel, Color panel, Dimensions panel...).
Regions
   are included in some editors. In that case, panels and controls are grouped there.
   For workspace optimization, it is possible to temporarily hide regions with the hotkeys
   :kbd:`T` and :kbd:`N` for the Toolbar and Properties Region respectively.
Controls
   Panels contain **Controls**.
   These can let you modify a function, an option, or a value. In Blender, there are several types of controls:

   Buttons
      .. figure:: /images/Button.jpg
         :align: right

      Permit access to a tool (Translate, Rotate, Insert Keyframe).
      These tools usually have a keyboard shortcut to speed up your work.
      To display the shortcut, just hover your mouse over a button to see the tooltip.


   Checkboxes
      .. figure:: /images/Checkbox.jpg
         :align: right

      Permit enabling or disabling of an option. This control can only contain a boolean value (True/False, 1/0).

   Sliders
      .. figure:: /images/Slider.jpg
         :align: right

      Allows you to enter floating values.
      These can be limited (e.g. from 0.0 to 100.0) or not (e.g. from -∞ to +∞).
      Notice that two types of sliders exist in Blender.

    Menus
       .. figure:: /images/List.jpg
          :align: right

       Permits a value to be chosen from a list.
       The difference between this and a Checkbox is that values are
       named and there can be more than two values on these menus.
