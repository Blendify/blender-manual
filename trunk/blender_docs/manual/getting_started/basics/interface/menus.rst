   The [Space]-menu


A menu with access to all *Blender* commands is available by pressing
:kbd:`Space` (shown in the picture). Simply start typing the name of the command you
need and let the search function of the menu do the rest.
When the list is sufficiently narrowed, :kbd:`LMB` on the desired command or highlight
it with :kbd:`Down` and :kbd:`Up` and select with :kbd:`Return`.


.. tip:: Menus on a Mac

   Because *Blender* doesn't use the standard OS menu system, if you are using a Mac,
   you likely have a redundant menubar at the top.
   To remove it see `this post <http://www.macworld.com/article/55321/2007/02/hidemenubar.html>`__
   on Macworld, but beware that it is somewhat complex.
   As an alternative: simply make *Blender* full screen with the last button in the info window header
   (most times at the top of the screen layout).
