   The [Space]-menu


Blender contains many menus, each of which is accessible from either a window's header or directly
at the mouse's location using :doc:`HotKeys </ce/hotkeys>` or by clicking :kbd:`RMB` on a window border,
a button or elsewhere on the screen.
A context sensitive menu will be displayed if there is one available for that interface element.

Additionally, a menu with access to all *Blender* commands is available by pressing
:kbd:`Space` (shown in the picture). Simply start typing the name of the command you
need and let the search function of the menu do the rest.
When the list is sufficiently narrowed, :kbd:`LMB` on the desired command or highlight
it with :kbd:`Down` and :kbd:`Up` and select with :kbd:`Return`.

If you miss the old tool box menu from version 2.4x,
you can add something similar with the *3D View: Dynamic Spacebar Menu* Add-on which
can be installed from the *Add-ons* tab of the *Preferences window*.

:doc:`Read more about installing Add-ons Â» </preferences/add_ons>`

Some menus are context sensitive in that they are only available under certain situations.
For example, the *specials menu* (:kbd:`W` hotkey)
is only available in a 3D window while *Edit Mode* is active.

While you are using *Blender*,
be aware of what mode is activated and what type of object is selected.
This helps in knowing what hotkeys work at what times.


Collapsing Menus
================

Sometimes its helpful to gain some extra horizontal space in the header by collapsing menus,
this can be accessed from the header context menu,
simply right click on the header and enable set it to collapsed.

.. tip:: Menus on a Mac

   Because *Blender* doesn't use the standard OS menu system, if you are using a Mac,
   you likely have a redundant menubar at the top.
   To remove it see `this post <http://www.macworld.com/article/55321/2007/02/hidemenubar.html>`__
   on Macworld, but beware that it is somewhat complex.
   As an alternative: simply make *Blender* full screen with the last button in the info window header
   (most times at the top of the screen layout).
