Defaults
********

There are two areas where Blender defaults are stored.

Preferences
   The :ref:`Preferences <prefs-menu>` file stores key-map, add-ons theme and other options.
Startup File
   The :ref:`Startup File <startup-file>` stores the scene, Workspaces and interface which is displayed at startup
   and when loading a new file (:menuselection:`File --> New`).

.. TODO2.8: more content about defaults would be useful:
   - how they relate to app-templates.
