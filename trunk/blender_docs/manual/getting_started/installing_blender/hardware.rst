Multi-Monitor Setup
===================


Graphic Tablets
===============

Graphics tablets can be used to provide a more traditional method of controlling the mouse cursor using a pen.
This can help to provide a more familiar experience for artists
who are used to painting and drawing with similar tools,
as well as provide additional controls such as pressure sensitivity.

.. note::

   If you are using a graphic tablet instead of a mouse and pressure sensitivity doesn't work properly,
   try to place the mouse pointer in the Blender window and then unplug/replug your graphic tablet. This might help.
