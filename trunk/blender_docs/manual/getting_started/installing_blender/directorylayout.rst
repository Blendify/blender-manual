Configuration and Data Paths
****************************

There are 3 different directories Blender may use,
their exact locations are operating system dependent.

LOCAL
   Location of configuration and runtime data (for self contained bundle)
USER
   Location of configuration files (normally in the user's home directory).
SYSTEM
   Location of runtime data for system wide installation (may be read-only).

For system installations both **SYSTEM** and **USER** directories are needed.

For locally extracted Blender distributions, the user configuration and data runtime data are
kept in the same sub-directory, allowing multiple Blender versions to run without conflict,
ignoring the **USER** and **SYSTEM** files.

.. note::

   You may need to have the "show hidden files" option checked in your file browser settings.


Platform Dependant Paths
========================

Here are the default locations for each system:


Linux
-----

LOCAL
   .. parsed-literal:: ./|BLENDER_VERSION|/
USER
   .. parsed-literal:: $HOME/.config/blender/|BLENDER_VERSION|/
SYSTEM
   .. parsed-literal:: /usr/share/blender/|BLENDER_VERSION|/


.. note::
   The path ./|BLENDER_VERSION|/ is relative to the Blender Executable &
   used for self contained bundles distributed by official blender.org builds.

.. note::
   The **USER** path will use ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` if its set:

   .. parsed-literal:: $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/blender/|BLENDER_VERSION|/


OSX
---

LOCAL
   .. parsed-literal:: ./|BLENDER_VERSION|/
USER
   .. parsed-literal:: /Users/$USER/Library/Application Support/Blender/|BLENDER_VERSION|/
SYSTEM
   .. parsed-literal:: /Library/Application Support/Blender/|BLENDER_VERSION|/

.. note::
   OSX stores the Blender binary in ``./blender.app/Contents/MacOS/blender``,
   so the local path to data & config is:

   .. parsed-literal:: ./blender.app/Contents/MacOS/|BLENDER_VERSION|/


Windows
-------

LOCAL
   .. parsed-literal:: .\\\ |BLENDER_VERSION|\\.
USER
   .. parsed-literal:: C:\\Documents and Settings\\$USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\Blender Foundation\\Blender\\\ |BLENDER_VERSION|\\
SYSTEM
   .. parsed-literal:: C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\AppData\\Roaming\\Blender Foundation\\Blender\\\ |BLENDER_VERSION|\\


Path Layout
===========

This is the path layout which is used within the directories described above.

Where ``./config/startup.blend`` could be ~/.blender/|BLENDER_VERSION|/config/startup.blend
for example.


``./autosave/ ...``
   Autosave blend file location. *Windows only, temp directory used for other systems.*

   Search order: ``LOCAL, USER``.

``./config/ ...``
   Defaults & session info.

   Search order: ``LOCAL, USER``.

``./config/startup.blend``
   Default file to load on startup.

``./config/userpref.blend``
   Default preferences to load on startup.

``./config/bookmarks.txt``
   File selector bookmarks.

``./config/recent-files.txt``
   Recent file menu list.

``./datafiles/ ...``
   Runtime files.

   Search order: ``LOCAL, USER, SYSTEM``

``./datafiles/locale/{language}/``
   Static precompiled language files for UI translation.

``./datafiles/icons/*.png``
   Icon themes for Blenders user interface. *Not currently selectable in the theme preferences.*

``./datafiles/brushicons/*.png``
   Images for each brush.

   Modules for add-ons to use (added to Python's sys.path).

``./scripts/addons_contrib/*.py``
   Another add-ons directory which is used for community maintained add-ons (must be manually created).

``./scripts/addons_contrib/modules/*.py``
   Modules for addons_contrib to use (added to Python's sys.path).

``./scripts/modules/*.py``
   Python modules containing our core API and utility functions for other scripts to import
   (added to Python's ``sys.path``).

``./scripts/startup/*.py``
   Scripts which are automatically imported on startup.

``./scripts/presets/{preset}/*.py``
   Presets used for storing user defined settings for cloth, render formats etc.

``./scripts/templates/*.py``
   Example scripts which can be accessed from: Text Space's Header --> Text --> Script Templates.

``./python/ ...``
