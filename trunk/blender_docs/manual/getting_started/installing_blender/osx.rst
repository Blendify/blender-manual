*****************
Installing on OSX
*****************

Check the :doc:`minimum requirements and where to get Blender </getting_started/installing_blender/installing>`,
if you haven't done so yet.

After downloading Blender for Mac-OSX, uncompress the file and drag ``blender.app`` onto the Applications folder.
Alternatively, you can launch Blender directly from the uncompressed folder.

.. tip::

   Because *Blender* doesn't use the standard OS menu system,
   you likely have a redundant menu-bar at the top.

   To remove it see `this post <http://www.macworld.com/article/55321/2007/02/hidemenubar.html>`__
   on Macworld, but beware that it is somewhat complex.
   As an alternative: simply make *Blender* full screen with the last button in the info window header
   (most times at the top of the screen layout).
