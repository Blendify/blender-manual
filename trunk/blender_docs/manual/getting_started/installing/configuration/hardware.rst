Input Devices
=============

.. Add note about emulate 3D buttom mouse and numpad.

Blender supports various types of input devices:

- Keyboard (recommended: keyboard with numeric keypad, english layout works best)
- Mouse (recommended: 3 button mouse with scroll wheel)
- NDOF Devices (also known as *3D Mouse*)
- Graphic Tablets

Usage of Mouse Buttons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Blender the :kbd:`RMB` (Right Mouse Button) is generally used for Selection
and the :kbd:`LMB` (Left Mouse Button) initiates or confirms actions.

The mouse usage summarized:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 85

   * - :kbd:`RMB`
     - To select an item
   * - :kbd:`Shift-RMB`
     - To add more items to the selection
   * - :kbd:`LMB`
     - to perform an action on the selection

.. note::

   There are a few corner cases where :kbd:`LMB` is used for selection.
   For example, the :doc:`File Browser </editors/file_browser/introduction>`.


Keyboards
---------

Non English Keyboards
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you use a keyboard with a non-english keyboard layout, you still may benefit from switching
your computer to the UK or US layout as long as you work with Blender.

.. note::

   You can also change the default keymap and default hotkeys from the
   :doc:`User Preferences </preferences/input>`, however this manual assumes you are using the default keymap.
   :doc:`Read more about Blender configuration </preferences/input>`


Graphic Tablets
---------------

Graphics tablets can be used to provide a more traditional method of controlling the mouse cursor using a pen.
This can help to provide a more familiar experience for artists
who are used to painting and drawing with similar tools,
as well as provide additional controls such as pressure sensitivity.

.. note::

   If you are using a graphic tablet instead of a mouse and pressure sensitivity doesn't work properly,
   try to place the mouse pointer in the Blender window and then unplug/replug your graphic tablet. This might help.


3D Mice
-------

3D Mice or :abbr:`NDOF (N-Degrees of Freedom) ` is hardware that you can use to navigate a scene in Blender,
Currenly only devices made by 3dconnexion are supported.
These devices are supprted in Blender's 3D View, allowing you to explore a scene,
as well as :ref:`Walk/Fly modes <3dview-walk_fly>`.

   See :doc:`Input Preference </preferences/input>` for more information on configuring peripherals.
