Properties
==========

Anti-Alias
   Create smooth mask edges rather than hard ones.
Feather
   Use or ignore feather points defined for splines see :ref:`Mask Feathers <mask-feather>` for more details.
Size
   Scene Size will give an image the size of the render resolution for the scene,
   scaling along when rendering with different resolutions. Fixed gives a fixed size in pixels. Fixed/
   Scene gives a size in pixels that still scales along when changing the render resolution percentage in the scene.
Motion Blur
   For animated masks, creating a motion blurred mask from the surrounding frames,
   with a given number of samples (higher gives better quality), and a camera shutter time in seconds.


Outputs

Mask
   The black and white output of the mask.


Example
