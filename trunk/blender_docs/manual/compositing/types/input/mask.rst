Input
=====

None.

Options
=======

Anti-Alias
    Create smooth mask edges rather than hard ones. 
Feather
    Use or ignore feather points defined for splines see :ref:`Mask Feathers <mask-feather>` for more details. 
Size
    Scene Size will give an image the size of the render resolution for the scene,
    scaling along when rendering with different resolutions. Fixed gives a fixed size in pixels. Fixed/
    Scene gives a size in pixels that still scales along when changing the render resolution percentage in the scene. 
Motion Blur
    For animated masks, creating a motion blurred mask from the surrounding frames,
    with a given number of samples (higher gives better quality), and a camera shutter time in seconds. 


Outputs
=======

Mask
   The black and white output of the mask.
