  Input Nodes
##############

Input nodes produce information from some source.
For instance, an input could be:

- Taken directly from the active camera in a selected scene,
- from a JPG, PNG, etc. file as a static picture,
- a movie clip (such as an image sequence or video), or
- just a color or value.

These nodes generate the information that feeds other nodes.
As such, they have no input-connectors; only outputs.
