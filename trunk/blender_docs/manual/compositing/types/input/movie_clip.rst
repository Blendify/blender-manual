   Movie clip node.

This node is a special node that uses some of the values taken from
footage cameras and trackings and links them to the output.
It is possible to load image sequences, but only Image and Alpha values 
will be available, because  the other outputs won't have any values 
associated with them.
When a tracked clip is chosen, Blender will fulfill the outputs using 
internal values taken from the tracking. So the controls for 
start and end frames will be defined at the movie clip editor.


Inputs
======

This node has no input sockets.


Properties
==========

  selecting it from the list.
