   Stabilize 2D Node.

Stabilizes the footage according to the settings set in
:menuselection:`Movie Clip Editor --> Properties --> 2D Stabilization`
For more information,
see :doc:`2D Stabilization </editors/movie_clip_editor/tracking/clip/properties/stabilization/index>`.


Inputs

   Standard image input.


Properties
==========

Movie Clip
   The movie clip whose stabilization to use.

Filter
   Various methods for the stabilization.
   Usually, the same as used in
   :menuselection:`Movie Clip Editor --> Properties --> 2D Stabilization --> Filter`.
   For technical details on their difference,
   `see this <http://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/ug/interpolation-methods.html>`_.
   But for most purposes, default of Bilinear should suffice.

Invert
   Invert the stabilization. If the stabilization calculated is to move the movie clip up by 5 units,
   this will move the movie clip down by 5 units.
