   Map UV Node.

While you can do quite a bit of overall coloring in post-production, there are limits. 
With this *Node* you can "re-texture" objects **after** they have been rendered. 

Using this node (and having saved the UV map in a multilayer OpenEXR format image sequence),
you can apply new flat image textures to all objects
(or individual objects if you used the very cool
:doc:`ID Mask Node </compositing/types/converter/id_mask>` to enumerate your objects) in the scene.

Thread the new UV Texture to the Image socket,
and the UV Map from the rendered scene to the UV input socket.
The resulting image is the input image texture distorted to match the UV coordinates. That
image can then be overlay mixed with the original image to paint the texture on top of the
original.
Adjust alpha and the mix factor to control how much the new texture overlays the old.

Of course, when painting the new texture,
it helps to have the UV maps for the original objects in the scene,
it is recommended to  keep those UV texture outlines around even, when shooting is done.

Examples
========

In the example below,
we have overlaid a grid pattern on top of the two "Emo" heads after they have been rendered.
During rendering, we enabled the UV layer in the RenderLayer tab (Buttons window,
Render Context, RenderLayer tab). Using a mix node,
we mix that new UV Texture over the original face.
We can use this grid texture to help in any motion tracking that we need to do.

In the next example, we overlay a flag on top of a cubie-type thing,
and we ensure that we Enable the Alpha pre-multiply button on the Mix node.
The flag is used as additional UV Texture on top of the grid. Other examples include the
possibility that there was used an unauthorized product box during the initial animation,
and it is needed to substitute in a different product sponsor after rendering.

.. hint:: 

   Of course, due to limits of this node, it is not recommended rush pre-production rendering under
   the guise of "fixing it later".
