Instructions
============
- Select the object you want to grow Ivy on.
- Enter Edit mode & select a vert that you want the Ivy to spawn from.
- Snap the cursor to the selected vert.
- Enter Object Mode & with the object selected:
- Since version 1.1.4 Sidebar Region > Create > Ivy Generator Panel adjust settings and choose Add New Ivy. The Add Default Ivy operator will use the default parameters during creation.
- This will generate your initial Ivy Curve & Leaves.
- From here you can access the Ivy menu in the sidebar.
- I suggest to make small changes & then press update ivy.
