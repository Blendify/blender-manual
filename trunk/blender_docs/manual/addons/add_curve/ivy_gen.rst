Instructions
============

#. Select the object you want to grow ivy on.
#. Enter Edit Mode and select a vertex that you want the ivy to spawn from.
#. Snap the cursor to the selected vertex.
#. Enter Object Mode and with the object selected:
   Since version 1.1.4 :menuselection:`Sidebar --> Create --> Ivy Generator panel` adjust settings and choose *Add New Ivy*.

The *Add Default Ivy* operator will use the default parameters during creation.
This will generate your initial Ivy Curve and Leaves.
From here you can access the *Ivy* menu in the Sidebar.
I suggest to make small changes and then press *Update Ivy*.
