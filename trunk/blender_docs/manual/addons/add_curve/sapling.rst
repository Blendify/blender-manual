Sapling Tree Gen
****************


Introduction
============

This add-on creates trees. There are many preset tree types to choose from or create your own.
The method is presented by Jason Weber & Joseph Penn in their paper Creation and Rendering of Realistic Trees

Activation
==========

- Open Blender and go to Preferences then the Add-ons tab.
- Click Add Curve then Sapling Tree Gen to enable the script.

Interface
=========

   :figwidth: 640px

Located in the :menuselection:`3D View --> Add --> Curve` menu.

Once the tree is created there's 8 settings to build your tree

Instructions
============

Geometry
--------

Bevel
   This determines whether the curve should be shown with its full thickness or only the underlying curve.
   Disabled by default to permit rapid feedback on parameter changes.
Bevel Resolution
   Determines how smooth the outline of the bevelled curve is.
   The lower this value, the smaller the number of vertices but
   the resulting geometry will be coarser.
Curve Resolution
   Changes the smoothness of the curve along its length. This is only relevant if *Handle Type* is set to Auto.
Handle Type
   Determines the method of interpolation of the curve between BÃ©zier points.
   Vector type results in fewer vertices but straight segments.
   Auto type smooths the segments but requires more expensive geometry.
Shape
   Governs the distribution of branches in order to effect the overall shape of the tree.
Custom Shape
   Todo.
Secondary Splits
   Todo.
Branch Distribution
   Todo.
Branch Rings
   Todo.
Random Seed
   Sets the basis on which all random values for the tree are generated.
   This can be changed to allow different trees with the same basic parameters to be generated.


Tree Scale
----------

Scale
   The underlying size of the tree in Blender units.
Scale Variation
   The maximum amount that the scale of the tree can vary (up or down) from the value of *Scale*.
Radius Scale
   The scale of the radius at the base of the tree.
Radius Variation
   The maximum amount that the radius scale of the tree can vary (up or down) from the value of *Radius Scale*.


Further Options
---------------

Preset Name
   The name of the preset to be exported. This will export all current properties of the tree to
   the Sapling preset folder as a py-file.
Export Preset
   Export all current properties.
Load Preset
   Any presets found in the Sapling preset directory may be imported when selected here.
Limit Import
   This can be used to restrict what geometry is created when a preset is imported.
   If selected, only two levels of branches and no leaves will be generated.
Branch splitting
   There are many variables to explore with branch splitting.
