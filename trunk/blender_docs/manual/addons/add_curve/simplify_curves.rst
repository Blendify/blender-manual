Activation
==========

- Open Blender and go to Preferences then the Add-ons tab.
- Click Add Curve then Simplify Curves to enable the script.
- This add-on is bundled with Blender.


Introduction
============

The Simplify Curves operator works on one selected curve object. It generates a new curve based on the original one.
The higher the *Distance Error* threshold is set the more control points are removed.

The Simplify F-Curves operator works the same way, but on selected F-curves.

Merge by Distance operator will help tidy up imported curves in Edit Mode.
