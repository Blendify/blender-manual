Installation
============

- Open Blender and go to Preferences then the Add-ons tab.
- Click Add Curve then Simplify Curves to enable the script.
- This add-on is bundled with Blender.


Introduction
============

The simplify curves Operator works on one selected curve object. It generates a new curve based on the original one.
The higher the distance error threshold is set the more controlpoints are removed. 

The simplify fcurves Operator works the same way, but on selected fcurves.

Merge by distance operator will help tidy up imported curves in edit mode.
