Usage
=====

TODO.


Properties
==========

Import
------

Forward / Up Axis
   Since many applications use a different axis for 'Up', these are axis conversions for
   Forward and Up axes -- By mapping these to different axes you can convert rotations
   between applications default up and forward axes.

   Blender uses Y Forward, Z Up (since the front view looks along the +Y direction).
   For example, its common for applications to use Y as the up axis, in that case -Z Forward, Y Up is needed.


Export

Path Mode
   When referencing paths in exported files you may want some control as to the method used since absolute paths
   may only be correct on your own system. Relative paths on the other hand are more portable
   but mean that you have to keep your files grouped when moving about on your local file system.
   In some cases the path doesn't matter since the target application will search
   a set of predefined paths anyway so you have the option to strip the path too.

   :Auto: Uses relative paths for files which are in a subdirectory of the exported location,
          absolute for any directories outside that.
   :Absolute: Uses full paths.
   :Relative: Uses relative paths in every case (except when on a different drive on windows).
   :Match: Uses relative / absolute paths based on the paths used in Blender.
   :Strip Path: Only write the filename and omit the path component.
   :Copy: Copy the file on exporting and reference it with a relative path.
