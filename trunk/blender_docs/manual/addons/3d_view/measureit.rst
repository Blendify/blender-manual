Description
===========

- MeasureIt is an add-on designed for displaying measures in the viewport, making the process of design objects with exact measures, easier. 

- These tools are extremely useful for any job that requires exact measurements, including architectural projects, technical design and 3D printing. 

- You can use it for: 

- Mesh vertex to vertex measure: Length between vertices in the same mesh. 

- Mesh vertex labeling: Add a label to any mesh vertex. This allows identify easily different areas or objects in the scene. 

- Object to Object: Distance between object origins, vertex to origin or vertex to vertex. 

- Object to origin: Distance between object origin to scene origin or vertex to scene origin. 

- Allows work with different scales.

- The measures can be used with Meshes, Empties, Lamps and Cameras. Blender units, Metric and Imperial are supported. 

- As all measure definitions are saved in the blend file, you can save the file and the next time you use it, the measures will be ready.
