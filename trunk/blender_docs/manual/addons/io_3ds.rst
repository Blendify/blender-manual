Usage
=====

This add-on can be used to import and export objects to/from the 3DS file format.
This format is commonly used to exchange files from Autodesk\ :sup:`®` 3ds Max\ :sup:`®`.


Properties
==========

Import
------

Forward / Up Axis
   Since many applications use a different axis for 'Up', there are axis conversion there settings,
   Forward and Up axis -- By mapping these to different axis you can convert rotations
   between applications default up and forward axis.

   Blender uses Y Forward, Z Up (since the front view looks along the +Y direction).
   For example, its common for applications to use Y as the up axis, in that case -Z Forward, Y Up is needed.
Size Constraint
   Scales the imported objects by 10 scene units until it reaches the size defined here.
   To disable set the *Size Constraint* to zero.
Image Search
   This enables a recursive file search if an image file can't be found.
Apply Transform
   Applies object transformations after importing.


Export

Selection Only
   Only export the selected objects. Otherwise export all objects in the scene.
   Note, this does not apply when batch exporting.
