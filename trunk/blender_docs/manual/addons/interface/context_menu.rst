Dynamic Context Menu
********************

Introduction
============

The dynamic context or "spacebar" addon has had a rework for the 2.8 series.
Originally designed as as a replacement for the legacy 2.49 spacebar menu, then updated up to 2.79 release,
this addon had evolved again to adjust to the new Blender tools and interface.
Access Search, Tools, Animation, Quick Favorites in the one place. Collections added. Menu's are reworked and updated to better reflect built in 2.8 series tools.
Note: If you have trouble accessing the add-on in the ui, in Preferences > Keymaps > Spacebar Action, you may need to set it to tools and save your preferences.


Activation
==========

- Open Blender and go to Preferences then the Add-ons tab.
- Click Interface then Dynamic Context Menu to enable the script.


Usage
=====

This script gives a basic menu with tools for quick access in the 3D View.
It provides access to many of the tools found in other menus,
but also packs a few features of its own, such as the Cursor menu.
It is context sensitive for Object, Edit, Sculpt, Pose, Weight/Texture/Vertex Paint modes and
object sensitive based on object selected in Edit Mode.
This script switches out the Operator Search menu, with a custom menu.
You can still use the :kbd:`Spacebar` to search by pressing outside the 3D View
when the script is active, or just press *Search* in the script.
