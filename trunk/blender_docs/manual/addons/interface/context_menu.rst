Dynamic Context Menu
********************

Introduction
============

This script gives a basic menu with tools for quick access in the 3D View.
It provides access to many of the tools found in other menus,
but also packs a few features of its own, such as the Cursor menu.
It is context sensitive for Object, Edit, Sculpt, Pose, Weight/Texture/Vertex Paint modes and
object sensitive based on object selected in Edit Mode.


Activation
==========

- Open Blender and go to Preferences then the Add-ons tab.
- Click Interface then Dynamic Context Menu to enable the script.


Usage
=====

This script switches out the Operator search menu, with a custom menu.
You can still use the :kbd:`Spacebar` to search by pressing outside the 3D View
when the script is active, or just press *Search* in the script.
