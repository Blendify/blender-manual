Dynamic Context Menu provides access to many of the menus found in the 3D View header.
It also packs a few features of its own, such as the Cursor menu.
It is context sensitive for the 3D View's modes and object sensitive based on object selected in Edit Mode.
This add-on pairs well with the :doc:`/addons/interface/brush_menus`.


Activation
==========

- Open Blender and go to Preferences then the Add-ons tab.
- Click Interface then Dynamic Context Menu to enable the script.

.. note::

   If you have trouble accessing the add-on in the interface:
   in :menuselection:`Preferences --> Keymaps --> Spacebar Action`, you may need to
   set it to *Tools* and save your preferences.
