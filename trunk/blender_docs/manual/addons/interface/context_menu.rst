Originally designed as as a replacement for the legacy 2.49 spacebar menu for the Blender 2.5 series.

This addon has evolved again to adjust to the new Blender 2.8 tools and interface.

Access Search, Tools, Animation, Quick Favorites, Modifiers, Collections and more.

Menu's are reworked and updated to better reflect built in 2.8 series tools.


Activation
==========

- Open Blender and go to Preferences then the Add-ons tab.
- Click Interface then Dynamic Context Menu to enable the script.

Note: If you have trouble accessing the add-on in the ui: in :menuselection:`Preferences > Keymaps > Spacebar Action`,
you may need to set it to :menuselection:`Tools` and save your preferences.


Information
===========

Dynamic Context Menu provides access to many of the menus found in the 3d view header.
It also packs a few features of its own, such as the Cursor menu.
It is context sensitive for Object, Edit, Sculpt, Pose, Weight/Texture/Vertex Paint modes and
object sensitive based on object selected in Edit Mode. This addon pairs well with the Dynamic brush menus.
