**************************
Transform Cache Constraint
**************************

The *Transform Cache Constraint* is used to stream animations from
:doc:`Alembic </files/import_export/alembic>` made at the transformation matrix level (for example
rigid bodies, or camera movements).

When :doc:`importing an Alembic file </files/import_export/alembic>`,
Transform Cache constraints are automatically added to objects with animated transforms. For
time-varying meshes (so deforming animations), the
:doc:`Mesh Sequence Cache modifier </modeling/modifiers/modify/mesh_sequence_cache>` is used.
