      Copy Rotation panel.

Target
   :ref:`ui-data-id` used to select the constraints target, and is not functional (red state) when it has none.

X, Y, Z
   These buttons control which axes are constrained.

   Invert
      The *Invert* buttons invert their respective rotation values.

Offset
   When enabled, this control allows the owner to be rotated (using its current transform properties),
   relative to its target's orientation.

Space
   Standard conversion between spaces.
