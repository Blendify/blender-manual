   Graph Editor: Driver example.


Drivers can use properties, numbers, transformations, and scripts,
to control the values of properties.

Using a F-Curve, the driver reads the value of the Driver Value and sets the value of the
selected property it was added to.

So from this example, if the Driver Value is 2.0 the property will be 0.5.

The Driver Value is determined by Driver Variables or a Scripted Expression.

Most the settings for the drivers :doc:`F-Curves </editors/graph_editor/fcurves/introduction>` are found in
the :doc:`Graph Editor </editors/graph_editor/introduction>`.
