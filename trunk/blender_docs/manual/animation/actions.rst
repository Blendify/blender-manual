When animating objects and properties in Blender, Actions record and contain the data.


.. figure:: /images/K_Animation_Actions_Data3.jpg

   Actions.


So when you animate an object by changing its location with keyframes,
the animation is saved to the Action.

Each property has a channel which it is recorded to, for example,
Cube.location.x is recorded to Channel X Location.


.. figure:: /images/K_Animation_Actions_Keyframes.jpg

   Graph Editor. Each Channel has an F-Curve represented by the lines between the keyframes.


Actions
   Record and contain animation data.
Groups
   Are groups of channels.
Channels
   Record properties.
F-Curves
   Are used to interpolate the difference between the keyframes.
Keyframes
   Are used to set the values of properties.


F-Curve Interpolation
=====================

.. figure:: /images/Animation_Driver_FCurve.jpg

   Graph Editor: Channel F-Curve.


The keyframes are set values by the user.

The *F-Curve* is used to interpolate the difference between the keyframes.

The *F-Curve* has different types of interpolation and also
:doc:`F-Curve Modifiers </editors/graph_editor/fmodifiers>`.

Most the settings for the :doc:`F-Curve </editors/graph_editor/fcurves>`
are found in the :doc:`Graph Editor </editors/graph_editor/introduction>`.


Basic Animation
===============

These are some common ways to animate objects.
These methods can be used on different objects, like armature bones in pose mode.


Insert Keyframes
----------------

This example shows you how to animate a cubes location, rotation, and scale.


- First, in the *Timeline*, or other animation editors, set the frame to 1.
- With the *Cube* selected in *Object Mode*, press :kbd:`I` in the 3D View.
- From the *Insert Keyframe Menu* select *LocRotScale*.
-    This will record the location, rotation, and scale, for the *Cube* on frame 1.
- Set the frame to 100.
- Use Grab/Move :kbd:`G`, Rotate :kbd:`R`, Scale :kbd:`S`, to transform the cube.
- Press :kbd:`I` in the 3D View. From the *Insert Keyframe Menu* select *LocRotScale*.

   Insert Keyframes.


To test the animation, press :kbd:`Alt-A` to play.


.. figure:: /images/Actions_Insert_Keyframe_01.jpg
   :width: 500px

   The animation on frames 1, 50, 100.


Auto Keyframe
-------------

.. figure:: /images/kia_Cube03.jpg

   Timeline Auto Keyframe.


Auto Keyframe is the red record button in the *Timeline* header. Auto Keyframe adds
keyframes automatically to the set frame if the value for transform type properties changes.

See :ref:`Timeline V Keyframe Control <animation-editors-timeline-autokeyframe>` for more info.


Keying Sets
-----------

.. figure:: /images/kia_Cube02.jpg

   Timeline Keying Sets.


Keying Sets are a set of keyframe channels.
They are used to record multiple properties at the same time.
There are some built-in keying sets, 'LocRotScale', and also, custom keying sets can be made.

To use the keying set, first select a keying set from the *Timeline* header,
or the *Keying Sets Panel*.

Now when you press :kbd:`I` in the 3D view,
blender will add keyframes for all the properties in the active keying set.

See :doc:`Keying Sets </animation/keyframes/keying_sets>` for more info.


Properties
----------

.. figure:: /images/kia_Cube04.jpg

   Keyframe properties.


Keyframes can be used to animate lots of different properties in Blender.
To add keyframes to a property in the UI, :kbd:`RMB` the property,
then select Insert Single Keyframe, or Insert Keyframes.
Insert Keyframes :kbd:`I` will add keyframes for the set of properties.


.. figure:: /images/Animation_Properties.jpg

   Properties, Drivers, Keyframes.


Properties have different colors and menu items for different states.

Gray - Property is not animated with Keyframes or Drivers.
   Insert Keyframes :kbd:`I`.
   Insert Single Keyframe.
   Add Drivers.
   Add Single Driver.
   Paste Driver.

Purple - Property value is controlled by a Driver.
   Delete Drivers.
   Delete Single Driver.
   Copy Driver.
   Paste Driver.

Green - Property has Channel with Keyframes.
   Insert Keyframes :kbd:`I`.
   Insert Single Keyframe.
   Clear Keyframes :kbd:`Alt-Shift-I`
   Clear Single Keyframes.

Yellow - Property has Keyframes on the current Frame.
   Replace Keyframes :kbd:`I`.
   Replace Single Keyframe.
   Delete Keyframes :kbd:`Alt-I`.
   Delete Single Keyframe.
   Clear Keyframes :kbd:`Alt-Shift-I`
   Clear Single Keyframes.

Each property also has some Keying Set options.
   Add All to Keying Set :kbd:`K`.
   Add Single to Keying Set.
   Remove from Keying Set.


Editing
-------

3D View.
   Insert Keyframes on current frame :kbd:`I`
   Delete Keyframes on current frame :kbd:`Alt-I`

Working with Actions
====================

.. figure:: /images/K_Animation_Actions_Create.jpg

   Action Browser.


When you first animate an object by adding keyframes,
blender creates an *Action* to record the data.

*Actions* can be managed with the *Action Browser* in the :doc:`DopeSheet </editors/dope_sheet/dope_sheet>`
*Action Editor* header, or the properties region of the :doc:`NLA Editor </editors/nla>`.

If you are making multiple actions for the same object,
press the **F** button for each action,
this will give the actions a *Fake User* and will make blender save the unlinked actions.

Objects can only use one *Action* at a time for editing,
the :doc:`NLA Editor </editors/nla>` is used to blend multiple actions together.
