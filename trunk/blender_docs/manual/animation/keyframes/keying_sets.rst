   Timeline Keying Sets.

Keying Sets are a collection of properties.

.. (alt) Keying Sets are a set of keyframe channels.

They are used to record multiple properties at the same time.
Now when you press :kbd:`I` in the 3D View,
Blender will add keyframes for all the properties in the active keying set.

There are some built in Keying Sets and,
also custom Keying Sets called *Absolute Keying Sets*.

To select and use a Keying Set, set the *Active Keying Set* in the
:ref:`Timeline Header <animation-editors-timeline-autokeyframe>`,
or the Keying Set panel, or press :kbd:`Ctrl-Alt-Shift-I` in the 3D View.
