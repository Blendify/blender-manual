Outliner window
***************

Description
===========

The *Outliner* window is used for easily navigating a complex scene.
The Outliner gives you a 2D representation of your complicated 3D world.
Use it to find things in your scene.

For example, suppose you sneeze while moving an object; your mouse flies off your desk
(gesundheit!) and the object is hurled somewhere off screen into space.
Simply use the outliner to find it; select it,
and move back to your 3D window to snap it back to your cursor (:kbd:`Shift-S`
*--> Selection --> Cursor*).

Another more practical example is to evaluate the impact of a change on related
:doc:`datablocks </data_system/datablocks>`.
Suppose you are looking at your ``TableTop`` object, and it doesn't look right,
the ``Wood`` material doesn't look right; you want it to look more like mahogany.
Since the same material can be used by many meshes,
you're not sure how many things will change color when you change the material. Using the *Outliner*,
you could find that material and trace the links that it has to every mesh in your scene.


Outliner view
-------------

.. figure:: /images/Manual-2-56-PartIII-Outliner-Window.jpg

   The Outliner window.


The *Outliner* is a kind of list that organizes things related to each other.
In the outliner, you can:

- View the data in the scene.
- Select and deselect objects in the scene.
- Hide or show an object in the scene.
- Enable or disable selection (to make an object "unselectable" in the 3D Views).
- Enable or disable the rendering of an object.
- Delete objects from the scene.
- Unlink data (equivalent to pressing the *X* button next to the name of a datablock).
- Easily select which render layer to render.
- Easily select which render pass to render (for example, you can choose to render just the *Specular* pass).


Selecting the outliner window type
**********************************

.. figure:: /images/Manual-2-56-PartIII-Outliner-Window-Type.jpg

   Change a window type to the Outliner.


Choose a window and :kbd:`LMB` on its current *Window type* button
(left-most icon in its header), and :kbd:`LMB` on *Outliner*.


Using the Outliner
******************

Each row in the *Outliner* shows a datablock. You can click the plus-sign to the
left of a name to expand the current datablock and see what other datablocks it contains.
If the row is already expanded, the icon to the left will be a minus-sign.
Clicking the minus-sign will collapse subordinate objects beneath the row.

You can select datablocks in the *Outliner*,
but this won't necessarily select the datablock in the scene.
To select the datablock in the scene, you have to activate it.


Selecting and activating
========================

Single selection doesn't require any pre-selection: just work directly with :kbd:`LMB`
(and/or :kbd:`RMB` - contextual menu, see below) *inside* the name/icon area.

When you select an object in the list this way,
it is selected and becomes the active object in all other 3D Views.
Use this feature to find objects in your 3D View, select them in the *Outliner*,
then zoom to them with :kbd:`NumpadPeriod` or if you don't have a numpad,
snap and center your cursor on them via :kbd:`Shift-S`
*--> Cursor --> Selection*, and then :kbd:`C`.


.. figure:: /images/Manual-2-56-PartIII-Outliner-Activate-Datablock.jpg

   Click [lmb] on the mesh data of the cube to activate Edit mode.


Activating a datablock
   *Activate* the datablock with :kbd:`LMB` on the *icon* of the datablock.
   Activating the datablock will automatically switch to the relevant mode.
   For example, activating the mesh data of the cube will select the cube
   and enter *Edit mode* while activating the object data of the
   cube will select the cube and enter *Object mode* (see right).

   Toggling pre-selection of a datablock.


Toggle pre-selection of a group of datablocks
   Useful when you want to select/deselect a whole bunch of datablocks.
   For this you must prepare the selection using, to your liking:

   - :kbd:`RMB` or :kbd:`LMB`,
   - :kbd:`Shift-RMB` or :kbd:`Shift-LMB`,
   - :kbd:`RMB` and drag or :kbd:`LMB` and drag,

   all *outside* the name/icon area. Those pre-selected have their line in a lighter color.
   You then can (de)select them with a :kbd:`RMB` *on* the name/icon area,
   which brings on a context menu (see bellow).


.. figure:: /images/Manual-2-56-PartIII-Outliner-Object-Operation.jpg

   Context menu for the Cube object.


Context menu
   Show the context menu for a datablock with :kbd:`RMB` on the icon or name.
   Depending on the type of the pre-selected datablock(s), you will have all or part of the following options:

   - *Select*.
   - *Deselect*.
   - *Delete*.
   - *Unlink* - To unlink a datablock from its "owner" (e.g., a material from its mesh).
   - *Make Local* - To create a "local" duplicate of this datablock.

   .. note::

      Some datablock types will not have a context menu at all!


Deleting a datablock
   Use :kbd:`X` to delete the selected datablock(s).

Expanding one level
   Use :kbd:`NumpadPlus` to expand one level down in the tree-list.

Collapsing one level
   Use :kbd:`NumpadMinus` to collapse one level up in the tree-list.

Expanding/collapsing everything
   Use :kbd:`A` to expand/collapse all levels of the tree-list.


Toggling object-level restrictions
==================================

The three following options, in the right side of the *Outliner* window,
are only available for objects:

**Visibility**


.. figure:: /images/Manual-2-56-PartIII-Outliner-Restrict-Visibility.jpg

   Restrict visibility


   Toggle visibility by clicking the "eye" icon for the object on the right-hand side of the *Outliner*.
   Useful for complex scenes when you don't want to assign the object to another layer.
   This will only work on visible layers - an object on an invisible layer will still
   be invisible regardless of what the *Outliner* says. :kbd:`V`
   will toggle this property for any objects that are pre-selected in the *Outliner*.


**Selectability**


.. figure:: /images/Manual-2-56-PartIII-Outliner-Restrict-Selection.jpg

   Restrict selection


   Toggle selectability by clicking the "arrow" icon. This is useful for if you have placed something in the scene
   and don't want to accidentally select it when working on something else.
   :kbd:`S` will toggle this property for any objects that are pre-selected in the *Outliner*.


**Rendering**


.. figure:: /images/Manual-2-56-PartIII-Outliner-Restrict-Renderability.jpg

   Restrict renderability

   Toggle rendering by clicking the "camera" icon. This will still keep the object visible in the scene,
   but it will be ignored by the renderer.
   :kbd:`R` will toggle this property for any objects that are pre-selected in the *Outliner*.


Searching
=========

You can search the file for datablocks,
either by using the *Search* menu in the header of the *Outliner*,
or by using one of the following hotkeys:

- :kbd:`F` - *Find*.
- :kbd:`Ctrl-F` - *Find (case sensitive)*.
- :kbd:`Alt-F` - *Find complete*.
- :kbd:`Ctrl-Alt-F` - *Find complete (case sensitive)*.
- :kbd:`Shift-F` - *Find again*.

Matching datablocks will be automatically selected.


Filtering the display
=====================

.. figure:: /images/Manual-2-56-PartIII-Outliner-Display-Mode.jpg

   Outliner Display dropdown.


The window header has a field to let you select what the outliner should show in the outline.
By default, the outliner shows *All Scenes*.
You can select to show only the current scene, datablocks that have been selected,
objects that are on currently selected layers, etc. These selects are to help you *narrow the
list* of objects so that you can find things quickly and easily.

All Scenes
   Shows *everything* the outliner can display (in all scenes, all layers, etc.)
Current Scene
   Shows everything in the current scene.
Visible Layers
   Shows everything on the visible (currently selected) layers in the current scene.
   Use the :doc:`layer </getting_started/basics/navigating/layers>` buttons
   to make objects on a layer visible in the 3D window.

Selected
   Lists only the object(s) currently selected in the 3D window.
   You can select multiple objects by :kbd:`Shift-RMB` -clicking.
Active
   Lists only the active (often last selected) object.
Same Types
   Lists only those objects in the current scene that are of the same types as those selected in the 3d window.
Groups
   Lists only :doc:`Groups </modeling/objects/groups_and_parenting>` and their members.

Example
=======

.. figure:: /images/Manual-2-56-PartIII-Outliner-Scene-Example.jpg

   The Outliner window in list mode.


The outline example shows that the ``.blend`` file has three scenes:
``Ratchet in Middle``, ``Ratchet on Outside``,
and ``Ratchet Out White``.
By clicking on the little plus-sign to the left of the name,
the outline is expanded one level.
This was done for the ``Ratchet in Middle`` scene. As you can see,
this scene has some ``World`` material settings, a ``Camera``, an ``Empty``, ``HandleFixed`` object...
All objects that were added to the scene.

By clicking the plus-sign next to ``ratchetgear``,
we can see that it has some motion described by the ``Animation`` " entry;
that it was based on a ``Circle`` mesh,
and that it is the parent of ``HandleFixed.002``,
which is in turn the parent of ``Plane.003``, and so on.


The neat thing is: if you select any of these datablocks here,
they will be selected in the 3D window as well, as far as this is possible.
Pressing :kbd:`NumpadPeriod`
with your mouse cursor in any 3D Window will center and align the view to that object.
Very handy. Also, pressing :kbd:`X` will delete it,
as well as all the other hotkeys that operate on the currently selected object.
