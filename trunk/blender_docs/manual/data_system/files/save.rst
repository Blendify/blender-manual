Saving Files

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`File --> Save`

There are a number of slightly different methods you can use to save your blend-file to your hard drive:

Save :kbd:`Ctrl-S`
   Save an existing blend-file over itself.
Save As :kbd:`Shift-Ctrl-S`
   Choose a file to save the blend-file to.
Save Copy
   Choose a file to save the blend-file to, but return to editing the original file upon completion.
   This can be used to save backups of the current working state without modifying the original file.

.. warning::

   If a file with the same given name already exists,
   the text field will turn red as a warning that the file will be overwritten.

.. tip::

   Use the *plus* or *minus* buttons to the right of the file name,
   or :kbd:`NumpadPlus`, :kbd:`NumpadMinus` to increase/decrease a number at the end of the file name
   (e.g. changing ``file_01.blend`` to ``file_02.blend``).


Options
=======

The save options appear in the operator panel.

Compress File
   When enabled, the saved file will be smaller, but take longer to save and load.
Remap Relative
   This option remaps :doc:`relative paths </data_system/files/relative_paths>`
   (such as linked libraries and images) when saving a file in a new location.
Save Copy
   This option saves a copy of the actual working state but does not make the saved file active.
