Relative Paths
**************

Many blend-files reference external images or other linked blend-files.
A path tells Blender where to look for these files.
If the external files are moved, the blend-file that references them will not look right.

When you specify one of these external files, the default option is to make the path relative.
Blender stores a partial path evaluated relative to the directory location of the referencing blend-file.
This choice helps when you need to reorganize folders or move your files.

With a relative path, you can move the blend-file to a new location provided
the externally linked files are moved along with it.
For example, you could send someone a folder that contains a blend-file
and a sub-folder of external images that it references.

When relative paths are supported, the File Browser provides a *Relative Path* check box,
when entering the path into a text field, use a double slash prefix (``//``) to make it so.

Relative paths are the default but this can be changed in the
:doc:`File </preferences/file>` tab
of the User Preferences Editor.

.. note::

   You cannot enter relative paths into a new *untitled* blend-file.
   Save it before linking to external files.

.. hint::

   If it is necessary to relocate a blend-file relative to its linked resources,
   use Blender's File :doc:`Save As </data_system/files/save>`
   function which has an option to *Remap Relative* file links.
