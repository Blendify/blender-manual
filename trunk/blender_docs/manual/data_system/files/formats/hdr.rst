Radiance HDR
************

Radiance is a suite of tools for lighting simulation originally written by Greg Ward.
Since Radiance had the first (and for a long time the only) HDR image format,
this format is supported by many other software packages.

Radiance (.hdr) files store colors still in 8 bits per component, but with an additional
(shared) 8 bits exponent value, making it 32 bits per pixel.
Only RGB can be stored in these files.
