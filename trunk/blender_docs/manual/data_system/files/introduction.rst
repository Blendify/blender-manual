The options to manage files are:

New
   Clears the current scene and loads startup.blend
:doc:`Open </data_system/files/open>`
   Open a blend file
:ref:`Open Recent <other-file-open-options>`
   Displays a list of recently saved .blend files to open
:ref:`Recover last session <other-file-open-options>`
   This will load the quit.blend file Blender automatically saves just before exiting.
   So this option enables you to recover your last work session, e.g. if you closed Blender by accident
:ref:`Recover Auto Save <other-file-open-options>`
   This will open an automatically saved file to recover it.

   Save the current blend file.

   Opens file browser to specify file name and location of save.

   Blender can use information stored in a variety of other format files which are created by
   other graphics programs.

      Pack all used external files into the .blend
