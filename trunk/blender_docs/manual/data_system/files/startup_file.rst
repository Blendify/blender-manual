When you start Blender or start a new project with the menu entry :menuselection:`File --> New`,
a new scene is created from the :doc:`startup scene </editors/3dview/startup_scene>` included with Blender.

This startup scene can instead be your own customized setup.

To change the startup scene, make all of the desired changes to the current scene or
current file and :menuselection:`File --> Save Startup File`.


Saving the ``startup.blend`` still stores user preferences in the file.
Only if a ``userpref.blend`` exists, it uses the preferences from that file.

ToDo: Restore :ref:`factory-settings`.
