*******************************
Current Screen Layout and Scene
*******************************

Scenes are a way to organize your work. Scenes can share objects, but can, for example,
differ from one another in their rendered resolution or their camera view.
The current window layout and scene are shown in the *Info* window header,
usually displayed at the top of your screen:


.. figure:: /images/Manual-Scene-Header.jpg
   :width: 600px

   Info window header. A) Window type icon,
   B) Menu, C) Screen Layouts, D) Scenes, E) Renderer Options
   F) Version of Blender currently running (click the Blender icon to the left to show splash screen).


Loading the UI (Opening a File)
===============================

Inside each .blend file, Blender saves the user interface layout - the arrangement of
screen layouts when the file is saved. By default, this saved UI is loaded,
over-riding any user defaults or the current screen layout. However, you can work on a blend
file using your current UI settings by ignoring the UI settings saved in the file.
This is done by restarting Blender or resetting it with
(*File* --> *New*, or :kbd:`Ctrl-X`),
and opening the file browser with (*File* --> *Open...*,
or :kbd:`F1`). Turn off the *Load UI* button in the file browser header,
and then open the file. This way,
Blender will not disturb your current screen layout when it loads the new file.


Working with Scenes
*******************

Select a scene to work on by clicking the up-down arrow next to the scene name.
Scenes and the objects they contain are generally specific to the project you are working on.
However,
they too can be saved in their current state to be re-used by pressing :kbd:`Ctrl-U`.
They will then appear the next time Blender starts or when the user selects
*File* --> *New* (:kbd:`Ctrl-X`).

Blender comes with one default scene, which contains a camera, a lamp, and a box.


Adding a Scene
==============

You can make a full copy of the current scene, start over with a blank slate,
or create a scene that has links back to the current scene;
objects will show up in the new scene, but will actually exist in the old one.
Use this linking feature when, for example, the original scene contains the set,
and the new scene is to contain the actors or props.


.. note:: Starting Over

   If you start with a new scene, be sure to add a camera and lights first!


Scenes are listed alphabetically in the drop-down list.
If you want them to appear in a different order, start them with a numerical ordinal,
like ``1-``.
The internal reference for a scene is the three-letter abbreviation "SCE".

To add a scene, click on the scene list button, and select *Add New*.
While you are adding a new scene, you have these options:


.. figure:: /images/Manual-Part-I-Interface-Scene-AddButton-Dialog.jpg

   Add scene popup menu.


Empty
   Create a completely empty scene.

Link Objects
   All objects are linked to the new scene.
   The layer and selection flags of the objects can be configured differently for each scene.

Link ObData
   Duplicates objects only. ObData linked to the objects, e.g. mesh and curve, are not duplicated.

Full Copy
   Everything is duplicated.

Usually, for your first scene, you make a full copy of the default. Alternatively,
you can just start with the default, and start editing the cube that is usually hanging around
waiting for you to do creative things.


Naming a Scene
==============

By :kbd:`Shift-LMB` -clicking on the scene name (usually ``Scene.001``),
you can change the name of the scene. For example,
``BoyMeetsGirl`` is usually the first of three acts.

You then proceed to model the props and objects in the scene using the *2-Model*
window layout.


Linking to a Scene
==================

You can, at any moment, link any object from one scene to another.
Just open the scene where these objects are,
use :kbd:`Ctrl-L` --> *To Scene...*,
and choose the scene where you want your objects to appear.
Those will be linked to the original objects; to make them single user (independent,
unlinked...) in a given scene go to that scene, select them and use :kbd:`U`.
You will be presented with a few options that allow you to free up the datablocks (Object,
Material, Texture...) that you want.


Removing a scene from the file
==============================

You can delete the current scene by clicking the *X* next to the name.
