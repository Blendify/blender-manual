Scene
=====

Camera
   Used to select which camera is used as the active camera.

.. _scene-background-set:

Background
   Allows you to use a scene as a background,
   this is typically useful when you want to focus on animating the foreground for example,
   without background elements getting in the way.

   This scene can have its own animation, physics-simulations etc,
   but you will have to select it from the *Scene* data-block menu, if you want to edit any of its contents.

   .. tip::

      This can also be used in combination with :ref:`Linking to a Scene <data-scenes-linking>`,
      where one blend-file contains the environment, which can be re-used in many places.

Active Clip
   Active movie clip for constraints and viewport drawing.
   

.. _data-scenes-props-units:

Units
=====

Length Presets
   Common unit scales to use.
Length
   None
      Uses :term:`Blender Units`.
   Metric, Imperial
      Standard unit of measurement for lengths.
Angle
   Standard unit for angular measurement.

   Degrees, Radians

   .. tip::

      When you are using *Degrees* the radian value is also displayed in the tooltip.

Unit Scale
   Scale factor to use when converting between :term:`Blender Units` and *Metric*/*Imperial*.

   .. tip::

      Usually you will want to use the *Length* presets to change to scale factor,
      as this does not require looking up values to use for conversion.

Separate Units
   When *Metric* or *Imperial* display units as multiple multiple values,
   for example, "2.285m" will become "2m 28.5cm".

.. Normally we would avoid documenting long lists of values
   however, this is not displayed anywhere else.
