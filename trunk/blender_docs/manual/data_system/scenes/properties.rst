Scene Properties

Scene
=====

Camera
   Used to select which camera is used as the active camera.
Background
   TODO.
Active Clip
   Active movie clip for constraints and viewport drawing.
   

Units
=====

Unit Presets
   Common units of measurement to use.

Length
   None
      Uses :term:`Blender Units`.

   Metric/Imperial
      Standard unit of measurement for lengths.

Angle
   Standard unit for angular measurement.
   
   .. tip::

      When you are using *Degrees* the radian value is also displayed in the tooltip.

Unit Scale
   Scale factor to use when converting between :term:`Blender Units` and *Metric*/*Imperial*.

   .. tip::

      Usually you will want to use the *Unit Presets* to change to scale factor,
      as this does not require looking up values to use for conversion.

Separate Units
   When *Metric*/*Imperial* display units as multiple multiple values,
   for example, "2.285m" will become "2m 28.5cm".


Color Management
================

Options to control how images appear on the screen.
