Data-Blocks
***********

The base unit for any Blender project is the data-block.
Examples of data-blocks include:
meshes, objects, materials, textures, node-trees, scenes, texts, brushes and even screens.

For clarity, bones, sequence strips and vertex groups are **not** data-blocks,
they belong to armature, scene and mesh types respectively.

Some common characteristics:

- They're the primary contents of the ``.blend`` file.
- They can link to each other, for reuse and instancing.
  *(child/parent, object/object-data, with modifiers and constraints too).*
- Their names are unique.
- They can be added/removed/edited/duplicated.
- They can be linked between files
  *(only enabled for a limited set of data-blocks)*
- They can have their own animation data.
- They can have custom properties.


When doing more complex projects managing data-blocks becomes more important,
especially when inter-linking ``.blend`` files.

Users (Garbage Collection)
==========================

It's good to be aware of how Blender,
handles data-blocks life-time, when they are freed and why.

Blender follows the general rule where unused data is eventually removed.

Since its common to add and remove a lot of data while working,
this has the advantage of not having to manually manage every single data-block.

This works by skipping zero user data-blocks when writing ``.blend`` files.

In some cases you want to save a data-block even when its unused
*(typically for re-usable asset libraries).* see `Fake User`_.


Fake User
---------

Since zero user data-blocks aren't saved.
There are times when you want to force the data to be kept irrespective of its users.

If you're building a ``.blend`` file to serve as a library of things that you intend to link-to from *other* files,
you'll need to make sure that they don't accidentally get deleted from the library file.

Do this by giving the data-blocks a *Fake User*,
by pressing the *F* button next to the name of the data-block.
This prevents the user count from ever becoming zero: therefore,
the data-block won't be deleted.
(since Blender doesn't keep track of how many other files link to this one.)


Users (Sharing)
===============

Many data-blocks can be shared among other data-blocks,

Examples where sharing data is common.

- Sharing textures among materials.
- Sharing meshes between objects (instances).
- Sharing animated actions between objects,
  for example to make all the lights dim together.

You can also share data-blocks between files, see.

- :doc:`linked libraries </data_system/linked_libraries>`.


Removing Data-Blocks
====================

As covered in `Users (Garbage Collection)`_, data-blocks are typically removed when they're no longer used.

There are some exceptions to this however.

Scenes, text, can be removed directly.

Other data-blocks such as groups and actions can be *Unlinked* from the *Outliner* context menu.

.. tip::

   Some data (images especially) is hard to keep track of,
   especially since image views are counted as users.

   For data-blocks that can be unlinked - hold :kbd:`Shift` while pressing on the *X* button,
   This force-clears the user-count, so the data-block will be removed on reload.

Data-Block Types
================

.. EDITORS NOTE:
   Mostly we want to avoid long lists of data - but in this case,
   Its the only comprehensive list of data-blocks, and something which you can't
   find directly just though looking at the interface.
   ::
   TODO, add links to related docs for each type.

For reference, here is a table of data-blocks types stored in ``.blend`` files.


:Link: Library Linking, *supports bing linked into other blend files*.
:Pack: File Packing, *supports file contents being packed into the blend file*.


.. EDITORS NOTE:
   For each data-block, we have 2 lines.
   1) a terse description.
   2) how its used.
   ::
   Keep these short.
