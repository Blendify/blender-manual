Data-Blocks
***********

The base unit for any Blender project is the data-block.
Examples of data-blocks include:
meshes, objects, materials, textures, node-trees, scenes, texts, brushes and even screens.

For clarity, bones, sequence strips and vertex groups are **not** data-blocks,
they belong to armature, scene and mesh types respectively.

Some common characteristics:

- They are the primary contents of the blend-file.
- They can link to each other, for reuse and instancing.
  (child/parent, object/object-data, with modifiers and constraints too).
- Their names are unique.
- They can be added/removed/edited/duplicated.
- They can be linked between files (only enabled for a limited set of data-blocks).
- They can have their own animation data.
- They can have :doc:`Custom Properties </data_system/custom_properties>`.

When doing more complex projects, managing data-blocks becomes more important,
especially when inter-linking blend-files.

Users (Garbage Collection)
==========================

It is good to be aware of how Blender,
handles data-blocks lifetime, when they are freed and why.

Blender follows the general rule where unused data is eventually removed.

Since it is common to add and remove a lot of data while working,
this has the advantage of not having to manually manage every single data-block.

This works by skipping zero user data-blocks when writing blend-files.

In some cases, you want to save a data-block even when it is unused
(typically for re-usable asset libraries). see `Fake User`_.


Fake User
---------

Since zero user data-blocks are not saved,
there are times when you want to force the data to be kept irrespective of its users.

If you are building a blend-file to serve as a library of things that you intend to link to and from other files,
you will need to make sure that they do not accidentally get deleted from the library file.

Do this by giving the data-blocks a *Fake User*,
by pressing the *F* button next to the name of the data-block.
This prevents the user count from ever becoming zero: therefore,
the data-block will not be deleted.
(since Blender does not keep track of how many other files link to this one.)


Users (Sharing)
===============

Many data-blocks can be shared among other data-blocks,

Examples where sharing data is common:

- Sharing textures among materials.
- Sharing meshes between objects (instances).
- Sharing animated actions between objects,
  for example to make all the lights dim together.

You can also share data-blocks between files, see:

- :doc:`linked libraries </data_system/linked_libraries>`.


Removing Data-Blocks
====================

As covered in `Users (Garbage Collection)`_, data-blocks are typically removed when they are no longer used.

There are some exceptions to this, however.

The following data-blocks can be removed directly:
Scene, Text, Group and Screen.

Other data-blocks such as groups and actions can be *Unlinked* from the *Outliner* context menu.

.. tip::

   Some data (images especially) is hard to keep track of,
   especially since image views are counted as users.

   For data-blocks that can be unlinked hold :kbd:`Shift`, while pressing on the *X* button.
   This force clears the user-count, so the data-block will be removed on reloading.

Data-Block Types
================

.. EDITORS NOTE:
   Mostly we want to avoid long lists of data - but in this case,
   it is the only comprehensive list of data-blocks, and something which you cannot
   find directly just through looking at the interface.
   ::
   TODO, add links to related docs for each type.

For reference, here is a table of data-blocks types stored in blend-files.


:Link: Library Linking, supports being linked into other blend-files.
:Pack: File Packing, supports file contents being packed into the blend-file.


.. EDITORS NOTE:
   For each data-block, we have 2 lines.
   1) a terse description.
   2) how its used.
   ::
   Keep these short.
