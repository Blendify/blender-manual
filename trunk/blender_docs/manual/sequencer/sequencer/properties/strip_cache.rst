Similar to :doc:`Cache Settings </sequencer/sequencer/properties/cache_settings>` panel,
this panel will set types of images, that will be cached for single (active) strip.

Enable Strip Cache
   Enable special rule for active strip.
   When disabled, :doc:`Cache Settings </sequencer/sequencer/properties/cache_settings>` will be used.
Cache Raw
   Cache raw images read from disk, for faster tweaking of strip parameters at the cost of memory usage.
Cache Preprocessed
   Cache preprocessed images, for faster tweaking of effects at the cost of memory usage.
Cache Composite
   Cache intermediate composited images, for faster tweaking of stacked strips at the cost of memory usage.
