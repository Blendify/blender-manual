General settings for *Grease Pencil* strokes.


Stroke Depth Order
==================

2D Layers
   The Strokes drawing order respect the order of the 2D layers list (top to bottom)
   and ignores the real position of the strokes in 3D space.
   See :doc:`2D Layers </grease_pencil/properties/layers>` for more information.

3D Location
   The strokes drawing order is based on the stroke location in 3D space.

          Blue, Green and Red strokes in three different layers using 3D Location depth order.


Stroke Thickness
================

World Space
   The thickness is relative to world space.
   Stroke thickness change with the screen zoom factor.

Screen Space
   The thickness is relative to screen space.
   Stroke thickness remains the same regardless of the screen zoom factor.

Thickness Scale
   Sets a thickness scale factor for all strokes.


Further Options
===============

Force Fill Update
   Toggle the use of recalculation for filled strokes.
   When using modifiers the filled strokes must be calculated with every deformation to keep its accuracy.
   Keep in mind this extra calculations will have an impact on the performance (less :abbr:`FPS (Frames per Second)`).

Adaptive UVs
   UVs in textured strokes are calculated automatically depending on the stroke size.
