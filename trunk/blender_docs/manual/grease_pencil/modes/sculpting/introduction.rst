Overview
========

*Sculpt Mode* is similar to *Edit Mode* in that it is used to alter the shape of a drawing,
but Sculpt Mode uses a very different workflow:
instead of dealing with individual elements (points and edit lines),
an area of the model is altered using a brush.
In other words, instead of selecting a group of points,
Sculpt Mode manipulates teh drawing in the brush region of influence.
