Draw Brush
**********

Draw brushes are the special type of brushes that use *Grease Pencil* for drawing tools.
The brush can be changed from the tool setting.

The different draw brushes (pencil, Ink, marker, etc.) are settings variations of the same *Draw Brush*. 
you can create many brushes, each with unique settings 
to obtain different artistic result while drawing.

Common options
===============

.. figure:: /images/grease-pencil_modes_draw_brushes_draw-brush-data-block.png   
   :align: right

   Brush data-block panel.

Brush   
   The Data-Block Menu to select a preset brush type or a custom brush.
   
   Add Brush
      When you add a brush, the new brush is a clone of the current one.

.. note::

   In order to save in a blend-user a custom brush, tick Fake User.

Radius
   The radius of the brush in pixels.

   :kbd:`F` allows you to change the brush size interactively by dragging the mouse/pen.
   Typing a number then enter while using :kbd:`F` allows you to enter the size numerically.

      Use Pressure (pressure sensitivity icon)
         Uses stylus pressure to control how strong the effect is.

Strenght
   Control the stroke transparency (alpha). 
   From totally transparent (0.0) to fully opaque (1.0).

   You can change the brush strength interactively by pressing :kbd:`Shift-F`
   in the 3D View and then moving the mouse/pen and then :kbd:`LMB`.
   You can enter the size numerically also while in :kbd:`Shift-F` sizing.

      Use Pressure (pressure sensitivity icon)
         Uses stylus pressure to control how strong the effect is.

Input Samples
   Controls how often the input device is read to generate points on the stroke.
   Higher values give more precision (more points) but produce an irregular stroke,
   while lower values give less precision (fewer points) but produce a soften stroke.
   (0 disabled extra input device samples).

   You have to set up this value according to your input device to obtain
   the right balance between accuracy and softness for your strokes.
   See :doc:`Input Device </getting_started/configuration/hardware>` for more information.

Active Smooth
   The number of smoothing iterations to apply to the stroke while drawing.

Angle
   Direction of the input device that gives the maximum thickness to the stroke (0Â° for horizontal).

   Factor
      Amount of thickness reduction when the stroke is perpendicular to the *Angle* value.

Border Opacity Factor
   Amount of transparency (alpha) to apply from the border of the point to the center.
   Works only when the brush is using stroke materials of *Dot* or *Box* style.

   Aspect Ratio
      Controls the width and height of the alpha gradient.

      X, Y.

Post-Processing
----------------

Post-processing methods that are executed on the strokes 
when you finished drawing, right after releasing the :kbd:`LMB` or pen tip.
You can toggle the use of post-processing using the checkbox on the section panel header.

Smooth
   Strength of smoothing process on the points location along the stroke.

   Iterations
      The number of smoothing iterations to apply to the stroke.

Smooth Thickness
   Strength of smoothing process on the points thickness along the stroke.

   Iterations
      The number of smoothing iterations to apply to the stroke.

Subdivision Steps
   Number of subdivisions to apply to newly created strokes.

   Randomness
      Amount of randomness to apply on the points location after subdivision.

Trim Strokes End
   Automatically trim intersection strokes ends.

.. _grease-pencil-draw-brushes-stabilizer:

Stabilizer
----------

Stabilizer helps to reduce jitter on the strokes while drawing 
delaying and correcting points location on the stroke.
You can toggle the use of stabilizer using the checkbox on the section panel header.

Radius
   Minimum distance from last point before stroke continues.

Factor
   Smooth factor. Higher values gives smoother strokes but the drawing 
   sensation feels like you are pulling the stroke.

Randomize
----------

Adds randomness to points position along the stroke.
You can toggle the use of randomize using the checkbox on the section panel header.

Pressure
   Amount of randomness to apply using the pressure of the input device.

Strength
   Amount of randomness to apply to stroke strenght value (alpha).

UV
   Amount of randomness to apply to UV rotation.

Jitter
   Amount of jittering to add to the stroke.

   Use Pressure (pressure sensitivity icon)
      Uses stylus pressure to control how strong the effect is.   

Curves
=======

For more precise control on some strokes properties you can use a :doc:`curve widget </interface/controls/templates/curve>`.

Sensitivity
   Controls the sensitivity of the input device.

Strength
   Controls the stroke strength (alpha).

Jitter
   Controls the jitter amount on the stroke.

Display
=======

Icon
   Sets a predefined icon to use.

Custom Icon
   Allows definition of a custom brush icon.

   Image path
      Defines the path to the image to use as custom icon.

Show Brush
   Shows the brush shape in the viewport.

Show fill color while drawing
   Shows the brush linked material color in the viewport.
