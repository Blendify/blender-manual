Usage
=====

Selecting Brush and Material
----------------------------

In the Topbar select the brush and material to use with the tool.

Brush
   The :ref:`ui-data-block` to select a preset brush type or a custom brush.
   Box tool uses *Draw Brushes* types.   

Material
   Data-Block selector for the material.

   Pin Material (pin icon)
      Pin the material to the brush.

      The final appearance of the strokes is a combination of the brush and material used,
      binding the material to the brush gives more control and avoids a lack of coordination between the two.

For more information about brushes and materials see: :doc:`Draw Brush </grease_pencil/modes/draw/brushes/draw_brush>`
and :doc:`Material </grease_pencil/materials/introduction>`.
