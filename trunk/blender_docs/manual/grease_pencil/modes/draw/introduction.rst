Introduction

Draw mode is the mode in Grease Pencil that allows you to draw in the 3D Viewport.
This mode is actually the only one in wich new strokes can be created.

Already made strokes can not be selected in Draw Mode, for editing strokes you must use the
:doc:`Edit Mode </grease_pencil/modes/edit/introduction>` or 
:doc:`Sculpt Mode </grease_pencil/modes/sculpting/introduction>`.

Getting Started
===============

To create new strokes you have to select one of the drawing tools in the Toolbar.
The most common one is the :doc:`Draw tool </grease_pencil/modes/draw/tools/draw>`
for freehand drawings but there are many other tools to use for drawing, filling areas and erasing strokes. 
There are also some tools to create primitives shapes like lines, arcs, curves, boxes and circles.

See :doc:`Toolbar </grease_pencil/modes/draw/toolbar/index>` for more details.

When drawing, the final appearance of the strokes is the result of the combination 
of the Brush and material selected for the tool.

See :doc:`Draw Brush </grease_pencil/modes/draw/brushes/draw_brush>` 
and :doc:`Materials </grease_pencil/materials/introduction>` 
for more information about setting up drawing brushes and materials.
