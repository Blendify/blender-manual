Blender provides a variety of tools for editing *Grease Pencil* strokes.
These are tools used to add, duplicate, move and delete elements.


Accessing Stroke Editing Tools
==============================

These are available through the different tools in the Toolbar,
the Stroke menu in the 3D View header, and context menus in the 3D View,
as well as individual shortcut keys.
