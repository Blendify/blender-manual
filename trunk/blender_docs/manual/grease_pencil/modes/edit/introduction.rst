Blender provides a variety of tools for editing *Grase Pencil* strokes. 
These are tools used to add, duplicate, move and delete elements.

These are available through the different tools on the Toolbar,
the Stroke menu in the 3D View header, and context menus in the 3D View,
as well as individual shortcut keys.

Accessing Stroke editing Tools
==============================

The stroke editing tools are found in various places, and available through shortcuts as well.


Toolbar
--------

When you select a stroke and :kbd:`Tab` into edit mode,
the :doc:`Toolbar </grease_pencil/modes/edit/toolbar/index>` changes from *Object Tools* to *Stroke editing Tools*.
These are only some of the stroke editing tools.

The :doc:`Stroke Menu </grease_pencil/modes/edit/stroke_menu>` is located in the header.


Context Menus
