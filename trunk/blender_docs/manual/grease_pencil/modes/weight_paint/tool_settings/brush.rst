Painting needs paint brushes and Blender provides a Brush Panel within the Tool Shelf
when it operates in *Weight Paint Mode*.

Brush
   In the :ref:`Data-Block menu <ui-data-block>` you find predefined Brush Presets.
   And you can create your own custom presets as needed.

Radius
   The radius defines the area of influence of the brush.
Strength
   This is the amount of paint to be applied per brush stroke.   
Use Falloff
   When enabled, use Strength falloff for the brush.
   Brush Strength decays with the distance from the center of the brush.
Weight
   The weight (color) to be used by the brush.
