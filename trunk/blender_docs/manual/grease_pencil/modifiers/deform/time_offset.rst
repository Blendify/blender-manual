********************
Time Offset Modifier
********************

The *Time Offset* Modifier offsets the position of *Grease Pencil* keyframes.

For example can be used to start the same animation loop
at different times and avoid an unappealing synchronization of the loops.

Or if you have different character poses in several keyframes,
the Time Offset Modifier can be use to select which pose to show at a particular time in the animation.
This is especially useful for cut-out animation.
