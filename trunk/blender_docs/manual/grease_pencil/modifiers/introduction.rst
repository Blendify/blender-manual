Grease Pencil has their own set of Modifiers.
Modifiers are automatic operations that affect an object in a non-destructive way.
With modifiers, you can perform many effects automatically that would otherwise be
too tedious to do manually and without affecting the base geometry of your object.

They work by changing how an object is displayed and rendered, but not the geometry which you can edit directly.
You can add several modifiers to a single object to form `The Modifier Stack`
and *Apply* a modifier if you wish to make its changes permanent.

   the general appearance of or automatically add new geometry to an object.
