Introduction
************

Materials control the appearance of the *Grease Pencil* object.
They define the color and texture of its strokes and fill areas.

Setting up Materials
====================

*Grease Pencil* Materials can be created in the :doc:`Material properties </editors/properties_editor>`.

3D Viewport can be set to LookDev or Rendered shading, to interactively preview how the material looks in the scene.

*Grease Pencil* Materials are data-blocks that can be :doc:`assigned </render/materials/assignment>`
to one or more objects, and different materials can be assigned to different strokes.

In *Grease Pencil* the :doc:`brush </grease_pencil/modes/draw/brushes/introduction>` 
settings together with the material used will define the look and feel of the final strokes.

Components
==========

*Grease Pencil* Materials is a special shader that define the appearance
of the :doc:`stroke </grease_pencil/materials/components/stroke>` and
:doc:`fill </grease_pencil/materials/components/fill>`.
