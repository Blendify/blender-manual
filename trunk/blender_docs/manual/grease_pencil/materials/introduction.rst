Introduction
************

Materials control the appearance of the *Grease Pencil* object.
They define the color and texture of the strokes and filled areas.

The material are linked to the strokes, this means that any change in a material will change
the look of already made strokes.

*Grease Pencil* Materials are data-blocks that can be :doc:`assigned </render/materials/assignment>`
to one or more objects, and different materials can be assigned to different strokes.

In *Grease Pencil* the :doc:`brush </grease_pencil/modes/draw/brushes/introduction>`
settings together with the material used will define the look and feel of the final strokes.


Grease Pencil Shader
====================

*Grease Pencil* Materials use a special :doc:`shader </grease_pencil/materials/grease_pencil_shader>`
that define the appearance of the surface of the stroke and fill.
