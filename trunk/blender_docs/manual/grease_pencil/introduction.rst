Use the *Grease Pencil* tool to draw freehand sketches and annotations
in the 3D View, UV/Image Editor, Node Editor, or Movie Clip Editor.
The sketches are saved with the blend file.
Planning animation poses and motion curves, sketching out model topology,
and use as director's shot review tool are just a few of the applications.
