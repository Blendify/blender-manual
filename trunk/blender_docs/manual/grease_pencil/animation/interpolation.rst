Interpolate Panel
=================

When you are animating simple shapes you can use the interpolate tools
to automatically add new breakdown keyframes.

   Interpolate panel.

Interpolate
   Interpolates strokes between the previous and next keyframe by adding a *single* keyframe.
   When you are on a frame between two keyframes and click the Interpolate button
   a new breakdown keyframe will be added. This way you define
   the final interpolation for the new stroke.

Sequence
   Interpolate strokes between the previous and next keyframe by adding *multiple* keyframes.
   When you are on a frame between two keyframes and click the sequence button
   a breakdown keyframe will be added on every frame between the previous and next keyframe.

   Type
      Interpolation method to use for the sequence.

Interpolate All Layers
   When enabled, interpolated keyframes will be created on all layers, not only the active one.

Interpolate Selected Strokes
   When enabled, only selected strokes will be interpolated.

Remove Breakdowns
   Removes the breakdowns generated by the interpolate tool.

Selection Mask
   When enabled the interpolation only affect selected strokes.

.. note::

   The *Interpolate* and *Sequence* tools work better when the strokes in the previous and next keyframes
   have the same amount of points. For example when there are duplicated strokes on different keyframes
   only with different location, rotation or scale.
