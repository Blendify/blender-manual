Interpolate Panel
=================

When you are animating simple shapes you can use the interpolate tools
to automatically add new breakdowns keyframes.

   Interpolate panel.

Interpolate
   Interpolates strokes between previous and next keyframes adding a new keyframe.
   When you are on a frame between two keyframes and click interpolate button
   a new breakdown keyframe will be added and you will define
   the final interpolation for the new stroke.

Sequence
   Interpolate strokes between previous and next keyframes adding multiple keyframes.
   When you are on a frame between two keyframes and click the sequence button
   a breakdown keyframe will be added on every frame between previous and next keyframes.

   Type
      Interpolation method to use for the sequence.

Interpolate All Layers
   When enabled, interpolated keyframe will be created on all layers, not only the active one.

Interpolate Selected Strokes
   When enabled, only selected strokes will be interpolated.

Remove Breakdowns
   Removes the breakdowns generated by the interpolate tool.

Selection Mask
   When enabled the interpolation only affect selected strokes.

.. note::

   Interpolate and Sequence Tools work better when the strokes in the previous and next keyframes
   have the same amount of points. For example when there are duplicated strokes on different keyframes
   only with different location, rotation or scale.
