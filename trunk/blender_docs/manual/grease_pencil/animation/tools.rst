Interpolation
=============

Interpolate
-----------

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Draw Mode, Edit Mode, Sculpt Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Stroke --> Animation --> Interpolate --> Interpolate`
   :Hotkey:    :kbd:`Ctrl-Alt-E`

Interpolate strokes between previous and next keyframes adding a new keyframe.
When you are on a frame between two keyframes and press :kbd:`Ctrl-Alt-E` a new breakdown keyframe
will be added and you will define the final interpolation for the new stroke.


Sequence
--------

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   :Mode:      Draw Mode, Edit Mode, Sculpt Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Stroke --> Animation --> Interpolate --> Sequence`
   :Hotkey:    :kbd:`Shift-Ctrl-E`

Interpolate strokes between previous and next keyframes adding multiple keyframes.
A breakdown keyframe will be added on every frame between previous and next keyframes.

.. note::

   Interpolate and Sequence Tools work better when the strokes in the previous and next keyframes
   have the same amount of points. For example when are duplicated strokes on different keyframes
   only with different location, rotation or scale.
