Regions
*******

An Editor is subdivided into regions.


Main Region
===========

At least one region is always visible.
It is called the main region and is the most prominent part of the editor.


Each editor has a specific purpose, so the main region and
the availability of additional regions are different between editors.
See specific documentation about each editor in the
:doc:`Editors </editors/index>` chapter.

.. _ui-region-header:

Header
======

A header is a small horizontal strip with a lighter gray background, 
which sits either at the top or bottom of the area.
All editors have a header acting as a container for menus and commonly used tools.
:ref:`Menus <ui-header-menu>` and buttons will change with the editor type and
the selected object and mode.

   The Header of the 3D View editor.


If you move the mouse over an area,
the header of its editor changes to a slightly lighter shade of gray.
This means that it is "focused".
All hotkeys you press will now affect the contents of this editor.
The header can be hidden with :kbd:`Alt-F9`.


Tool Shelf
==========

The *Tool Shelf* by default on the left side contains the tool settings.
:kbd:`T` toggles the visibility of Tool Shelf Region.


Operator Panel
--------------

The Operator panel is a region thats part of the Tool Shelf containing only one panel.
In the 3D View it displays the properties of the :ref:`last operator <ui-redo-last>` executed and
in the File Browser the file in/export options.


Properties Region
=================

The *Properties Region* is by default on the right side.
It contains :ref:`Panels <ui-panels>`
with settings of objects within the editor and the editor itself.
:kbd:`N` toggles the visibility of Properties Region.


Arranging
=========

Scrolling
---------

A region can be scrolled vertically and/or horizontally by dragging it with the :kbd:`MMB`.
If the region has no zoom level, it can be scrolled by using the :kbd:`Wheel`,
while the mouse hovers over it.


Changing the Size and Hiding
----------------------------

Resizing regions works the same way as :doc:`/interface/window_system/areas`
by dragging its border.

To hide a region scale it down to nothing.
A hidden region leaves a little plus sign (see picture).
By :kbd:`LMB` on this, the region will reappear.

The Tool Shelf and Properties region have a shortcut assigned to
toggle between hide and show.

Position
--------

To flip a region from one side to the opposite press :kbd:`F5`, 
while the Region is  under the mouse pointer.

The header can also be flip by :kbd:`RMB` on it and
select the appropriate item from the pop-up menu.
If the header is at the top, the item text will read "Flip to Bottom",
and if the header is at the bottom the item text will read "Flip to Top".
