Headers
*******

All editors have a header (the strip with a lighter gray background containing icon buttons).
The header may be at the top (as with the *Properties Editor*)
or the bottom (as with the 3D View) of a area.

.. figure:: /images/interface-window_system-headers-header_example.jpg

   The Header of the 3D View editor.


If you move the mouse over a area, the header of its editor changes to a slightly lighter shade of gray.
This means that it is "focused".
All hotkeys you press will now affect the contents of this editor.


Hiding and Showing a Header
===========================

To hide a header, move your mouse over border of the header,
until the pointer takes the form of an up/down arrow. Then click,
hold and drag with :kbd:`LMB`  to scale down the header to zero.

.. list-table::

   * - .. figure:: /images/interface-window_system-headers-hide.png

     - .. figure:: /images/interface-window_system-headers-show_02.jpg


A hidden header leaves a little plus sign (see picture).
By :kbd:`LMB` this, the header will reappear.

.. note::

   In the 3D View, there are up to two more of these little plus signs
   (to the top left and right of the area). Those will open shelfs with tools and properties,
   not a second header.


Scrolling and Position
======================

The Header can be scrolled horizontally by dragging it with the :kbd:`MMB` or
by using the :kbd:`Wheel`, while the mouse hovers over it.

To move a header from top to bottom or the other way round,
simply :kbd:`RMB` on it and select the appropriate item from the pop-up menu.
If the header is at the top, the item text will read "Flip to Bottom",
and if the header is at the bottom the item text will read "Flip to Top".


Editor Type Selector
====================

:kbd:`LMB` clicking on the first icon at the left side of a header allows changing the Editor type.
Every area in Blender may contain any type of editor,
allowing you to customize your window layout to your own work flows.


Menus and Buttons
=================

Most headers exhibit a set of menus, located immediately next
to the first *Editor Type* selector.

Menus allow you to directly access many features and commands,
so just look through them to see what is there.
All Menu entries show the relevant shortcut keys, if any.

Menus and buttons will change with *Editor Type* and the selected object and mode.
They only show the actions that can be performed.


Collapsing Menus
----------------

Sometimes its helpful to gain some extra horizontal space in the header by collapsing menus,
this can be accessed from the header context menu,
simply right click on the header and enable set it to collapsed.

.. list-table::

   * - .. figure:: /images/header_menu_expand.jpg
          :width: 320px

          Right-click on any of the header menus.

     - .. figure:: /images/header_menu_collapsed.jpg
          :width: 320px

          Access the menu from the collapsed icon.
