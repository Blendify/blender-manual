Introduction
************

When you start Blender you should see a screen similar to this
(the splash screen in the center will change with new versions):

.. figure:: /images/blender_default_startup.png

   Initial Blender screen.


Every window you see can be further broken down into separate areas
(as described in the section on
:doc:`arranging areas </interface/editors/arranging_areas>`).
The default scene is described below.


The default screen
==================

The default scene is separated into five areas and is loaded each time you start Blender or a new file.
These five areas are:

- The Info Editor (shaded red) at the top.
  (The Info Editor used mainly for its header).
- A large 3D View (shaded green).
- A Timeline at the bottom (shaded purple).
- An Outliner at the top right (shaded yellow).
- A Properties Editor at the bottom right (shaded blue).

As an introduction we will cover a few of the basic elements.

User Interface Principles
=========================

   This is an example of Blender's multiple window support.

Non Overlapping
   The UI is designed to allow you to view all relevant options and tools at a glance
   without pushing or dragging editors around.

Non Blocking
   Tools and interface options do not block the user from any other parts of Blender.
   Blender typically doesn't use pop-up boxes
   (requiring users to fill in data before running an operation).

Non Modal Tools
   Tools can be accessed efficiently without taking time to select between different tools.
   Many tools use consistent and predictable,
   mouse and keyboard actions for interaction.
