Introduction
************

After starting Blender and closing the :ref:`Splash Screen <splash>`
your Blender window should look something similar to the image below:

.. figure:: /images/blender_default_startup.png

   Initial Blender screen.


Every window you see can be further broken down into separate areas
(as described in the section on
:doc:`arranging areas </interface/editors/arranging_areas>`).
The default screen is described below.


The default screen
==================

The default screen is separated into five areas and is loaded each time you start Blender or a new file.
These five areas are:

- The Info Editor at the top.
- A large 3D View.
- A Timeline at the bottom.
- An Outliner at the top right.
- A Properties Editor at the bottom right.

In this chapter, each of the the basic elements of an editor will be discussed.

   Default Blender scene and area arrangement.

   Red: the Info Editor, green: the 3D View, purple: the Timeline,
   yellow: the Outliner, blue: the Properties Editor.


User Interface Principles
=========================

Non Overlapping
   The UI is designed to allow you to view all relevant options and tools at a glance
   without pushing or dragging editors around.

Non Blocking
   Tools and interface options do not block the user from any other parts of Blender.
   Blender typically does not use pop-up boxes
   (requiring users to fill in data before running an operation).

Non Modal Tools
   Tools can be accessed efficiently without taking time to select between different tools.
   Many tools use consistent and predictable, mouse and keyboard actions for interaction.
