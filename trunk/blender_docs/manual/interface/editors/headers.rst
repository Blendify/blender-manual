Headers
*******

All editors have a header (the strip with a lighter gray background containing icon buttons).
The header may be at the top (as with the *Properties Editor*) 
or the bottom (as with the 3D View) of a window's area. 
The picture below shows the header of the 3D View:

.. figure:: /images/interface-window_system-headers-header_example.jpg


If you move the mouse over a window, the header of its editor changes to a slightly lighter shade of gray.
This means that it is "focused".
All hotkeys you press will now affect the contents of this editor.


Hiding a header
===============

.. figure:: /images/interface-window_system-headers-hide.jpg


To hide a header, move your mouse over border of the header,
until the pointer takes the form of an up/down arrow. Then click,
hold and drag with :kbd:`LMB`  to scale down the header to zero.


Showing a header
================

.. figure:: /images/interface-window_system-headers-show_02.jpg


A hidden header leaves a little plus sign (see picture). By :kbd:`LMB` this,
the header will reappear.

.. note::

   In the 3D View, there are up to two more of these little plus signs
   (to the top left and right of the window). Those will open panels with several tools,
   not a second header.


Header position
===============

To move a header from top to bottom or the other way round,
simply :kbd:`RMB` on it and select the appropriate item from the pop-up menu.
If the header is at the top, the item text will read "Flip to Bottom",
and if the header is at the bottom the item text will read "Flip to Top".

.. tip:: Theme colors

   Blender allows for most of its interface color settings to be changed to suit the needs of the user.
   If you find that the colors you see on screen do not match those mentioned
   in the Manual then it could be that your default theme has been altered.
   Creating a new theme or selecting/altering a pre-existing one can be done by selecting the
   :doc:`User Preferences </preferences/index>` editor and clicking on the *Themes* tab.


Editor type button
==================

:kbd:`LMB` clicking on the first icon at the left side of a header allows changing the Editor type.
Every window frame in Blender may contain any type of editor,
allowing you to customize your window layout to your own work flows.


Menus and buttons
=================

Most headers exhibit a set of menus, located immediately next 
to this first *Editor Type* Menu button, which can be hidden - again with a little minus sign.
So if you cannot find a menu that was mentioned somewhere, try looking for a little plus sign
(once again) next to the *Editor Type* button. By clicking :kbd:`LMB` on it,
the menu will come back.

Menus allow you to directly access many features and commands,
so just look through them to see what's there.
All Menu entries show the relevant shortcut keys, if any.

Menus and buttons will change with *Editor Type* and the selected object and mode.
They only show the actions that can be performed.


Collapsing Menus
----------------

Sometimes its helpful to gain some extra horizontal space in the header by collapsing menus,
this can be accessed from the header context menu,
simply right click on the header and enable set it to collapsed.

.. list-table::

   * - .. figure:: /images/header_menu_expand.jpg
          :width: 320px

          Right-click on any of the header menus.

     - .. figure:: /images/header_menu_collapsed.jpg
          :width: 320px

          Access the menu from the collapsed icon.
