Panels
******

Panels are collapsible sections within regions to help organize the interface.
They are used in the *Properties Editor*, but also
for example in the *Tool Shelf* and the *Properties region*.
Some panels are only shown depending on the editors mode.


Collapsing and expanding
========================

A triangle on the left of the title shows the expanded (▼) and collapsed (►) state of the panel.

   Panels in expanded and collapsed state.

   Expanded (1) and collapsed (2) Panels in the Properties Editor (right area)
   and in the additional Regions of the 3D View Editor (left area)

- A click with the :kbd:`LMB` on the title area of a panel expands or collapses it.
- A :kbd:`LMB` drag motion over the title area will expand or collapse many at once.
- A :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` click on the title area of a specific panel will collapse
  all other panels and make this the only expanded one.


Position
========

You can change the position of a panel within its region by clicking and
dragging it with the :kbd:`LMB` on the little widget (\:\:\:\:) in the upper right corner.


Zoom
====

The zoom factor of a whole region with panels can be changed by
:kbd:`Ctrl-MMB` clicking and moving the mouse anywhere within that region
or use the :kbd:`NumpadPlus` and :kbd:`NumpadMinus` to zoom in and out the contents.
Pressing :kbd:`Home` (Show All) will reset the zooming at the screen/panel focused by the mouse pointer.


Alignment
=========

The alignment of the panels in the *Properties Editor* can be changed
between vertical and horizontal. To do this click with :kbd:`RMB` somewhere
within the main region of the *Properties Editor* and choose either
*Horizontal* or *Vertical* from the appearing menu. Keep in mind though that
the panels are optimized for vertical alignment.
