Stroke
   Sets the line color and opacity.
Fill
   Sets the color of the interior space enclosed by the strokes.
   Increase the opacity from zero to make the fill visible.
   Fill works best on convex shapes, unless you are using *High Quality Fill* (see below).

Volumetric Strokes
   Draw strokes as a series of filled spheres, resulting in an interesting volumetric effect.
   Get best results with partial opacity and large stroke widths.

High Quality Fill
   Uses a better fill algorithm that works better for concave drawings.
