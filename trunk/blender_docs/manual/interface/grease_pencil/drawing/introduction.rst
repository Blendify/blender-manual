Introduction
************

Enable the *Grease Pencil* by clicking *Draw, Line, Poly or Erase* from the Tool Shelf :kbd:`T`.
A new layer will be automatically added for you to draw on.

A new layer can be added from the Grease Pencil panel in the Properties region.
This panel can also be used to customize the color, opacity and thickness of the pencil lines.
Changes to these settings will affect all strokes on the current layer.

*Grease Pencil* sketches can be converted to editable geometry and used to aid the animation process.

Drawing
=======

The Tool Shelf provides a number of options for drawing with the *Grease Pencil* which are detailed below.
The Tool Shelf can be seen in the screenshot :ref:`fig-gp-tool-properties` below.

Grease Pencil Mode and Shortcut Summary
---------------------------------------

Draw :kbd:`D-LMB`
   Draw a new stroke (multiple short, connected lines). The stroke will finish when you release the mouse button.
Line :kbd:`Ctrl-D-LMB`
   Draw a new line in rubber band mode. The line will finish when you release the mouse button.
Poly :kbd:`Ctrl-D-RMB`
   Draw connected lines by clicking at various points. Lines will be automatically added to connect the two points.
Erase :kbd:`D-RMB`
   Erases segments of strokes that fall within the radius of the eraser "brush".
   The erasing will continue until the mouse button is released.
   If begun with *Erase*, either :kbd:`RMB` or :kbd:`LMB` will erase strokes.
   The size of the eraser "brush" can be controlled with :kbd:`Wheel`, or with
   :kbd:`NumpadPlus` and :kbd:`NumpadMinus`, while still holding :kbd:`RMB`.


Sketching Sessions
------------------

A Sketching Session allows for rapid sketching with the *Grease Pencil* when
multiple strokes are desired. With this option set,
a sketching session starts when a *Grease Pencil* stroke is made.
The type of session (Draw, Line, Poly, Erase)
is determined by the first stroke made which can be done via hotkeys or the Tool Shelf.
Use :kbd:`Esc` or :kbd:`Return` to exit the sketching session. Note that in an Erase
Sketching Session both :kbd:`LMB` or :kbd:`RMB` can be used once the session has started.


Drawing Settings
================

   Grease Pencil Drawing Settings.


In the *Grease Pencil Panel* of the *Tool* shelf :kbd:`T`
there are several choices for *Drawing Settings*.

View
   New strokes are locked to the view.
Cursor *(3D View only)*
   New strokes are drawn in 3D-space,
   with position determined by the 3D cursor and the view rotation at the time of drawing.
   *Cursor* is available as an option in the *UV/Image Editor*
   but it functions identically to the *View* option.  *(3D View only)*
Surface
   New strokes are drawn in 3D-space, with their position projected onto the first visible surface.
   *(3D View only)*
Stroke
   New strokes are drawn in 3D-space, with their position projected onto existing visible strokes.
   Note that strokes created with *View* are not in 3D-space and are not considered for this projection.
   *(3D View only)*

Only Endpoints
   Applies the drawing setting only to the endpoints of the stroke.
   The part of the stroke between the endpoints is adjusted to lie on a plane passing through the endpoints.

.. tip:: Notes For Tablet Users:

   - The thickness of a stroke at a particular point is affected
     by the pressure used when drawing that part of the stroke.
   - The "eraser" end of the stylus can be used to erase strokes.
