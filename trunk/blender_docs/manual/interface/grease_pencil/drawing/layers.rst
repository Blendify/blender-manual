Grease Pencil sketches are organized in layers,
much like the image layers in the GIMP or Photoshop\ :sup:`Â®`\ .
These layers are not related to any of the other layer systems in Blender.

The layers' main purpose is to gather sketches that are related in some
meaningful way (e.g. "blocking notes", "director's comments on blocking", or "guidelines").
For this reason, all the strokes on a layer (not just those made after a particular change)
are affected by that layer's color, opacity, and stroke thickness settings.

Layers are managed in the *Grease Pencil Panel* of the *Properties region* :kbd:`N` shown here.
