Tool System
***********

Tools are accessed from the :ref:`Toolbar <ui-region-toolbar>`,

This is a general introduction to tools, individual tools have their own documentation.

There can only be one active tool which is stored for each space & mode.

Tools may set their own keys which override other keys
although typically they use the :kbd:`LMB`, sometimes with modifier keys.
*Key-maps can be edited from the preferences.*

Some tools define gizmos (*Shear* and *Spin* for example) to help control the tool.


Toolbar
=======

The Toolbar shows buttons for each tool.

For tools which have an arrow :kbd:`LMB` drag opens up the sub-menu so you can select other tools.

When the Toolbar is set to a narrow width, text isn't displayed.

Holding your cursor over a tool for a short time shows it's name, keep hovering to show the full tooltip.

.. tip::

   Expand the Toolbar to show icons on two columns instead of one.

   Expand the Toolbar even more to show icons with titles.


Properties
==========

Tools can have their own settings, these are available multiple place:

- The :menuselection:`Sidebar --> Tools --> Active Tool` panel.
- The *Active Tool* tab in the properties space.
- The *Tool Settings* region.


Switching Tools
===============

Keyboard tool switching is not enabled by default,
set the key-map preference :ref:`keymap-blender_default-spacebar_action` to *Tools*.
Then you can be used as a modifier key (similar to pressing :kbd:`Ctrl` or :kbd:`Shift`).

:kbd:`Spacebar-T` for Transform, :kbd:`Spacebar-D` for Annotate, :kbd:`Spacebar-M` for measure, etc.

*The accelerator keys are displayed in the pop-up.*


Cycling Tools
-------------

If you bind a key to a tool which is part of a group, you can enable the *Cycle* option in the keymap editor,
successive presses cycles through tools in that group.
