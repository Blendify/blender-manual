Annotate Tool
*************

The annotation tool is available in multiple editors.
With it notes can be added to e.g. 3D objects or node setups.

The annotation tool can be activated in the Toolbar on the left side.
It has a couple of sub-tools listed below.

Annotate
   Draw free-hand strokes in the main window.
Annotate Line
   Click and drag to create a line.
Annotate Polygon
   Click multiple times to create multiple connected lines.
   The current polygon is finished when :kbd:`Esc` or :kbd:`RMB` is pressed.
Annotate Eraser
   Click and drag to remove lines drawn previously.


Settings
========

3D Editor
---------

When creating new annotations in the 3D View, there is one tool setting.

Placement
   The *Placement* option determines where the line is drawn in 3D space.

   3D Cursor
      Draw on an imaginary plane that goes through the 3D cursor.
   View
      Draw in screen space instead of in 3D space.
      That means, that the line will stay on the same position in the screen,
      even when e.g. the camera rotates.
   Surface
      Project the line on the surface under the mouse.

The eraser has a *Radius* setting.

There is a :menuselection:`View --> Annotations` panel in the right Sidebar of the 3D view.
In it, multiple annotation layers can be managed.
Furthermore, it allows to adjust the thickness and color of existing and new strokes.

Optionally, *Onion Skin* can be enabled to show a preview of strokes made in frames close by the current frame.


2D Editors
----------

In 2D editors, the *Placement* option does not exist.
When the annotation tool is enabled, the settings for managing multiple layers
can be found in the :menuselection:`Tool --> Active Tool` panel in the right Sidebar.
