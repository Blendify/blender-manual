Menus

Blender uses a variety of different menus for accessing options and tools.


.. _ui-header-menu:

Header Menus
============

Most :ref:`headers <ui-region-header>` exhibit a set of menus, located immediately next
to the first *Editor Type* selector.
Header menus are used to configure the editor and access tools.
All Menu entries show the relevant shortcut keys, if any.

.. figure:: /images/interface_controls_buttons_menus_menu-button.png
   :align: center

   View menu in the Header of 3D Viewport.


Collapsing Menus
----------------

Sometimes it's helpful to gain some extra horizontal space in the header by collapsing menus.
This can be accessed from the header context menu,
click :kbd:`RMB` on the header and select *Collapse Menus*.

.. list-table::

   * - .. figure:: /images/interface_controls_buttons_menus_header-menu-expand.png

          Right-click on any of the header menus.

     - .. figure:: /images/interface_controls_buttons_menus_header-menu-collapsed.png

          Access the menu from the collapsed icon.


Select Menus
============

   :align: right
   :width: 200px
   :figwidth: 200px

   The 3D Viewport Mode Select menu.

The Select menu (short selector) lets you choose between a set of options.
Select menu appears as an icon and/or text with down arrow on the right side of the button.
The menu options are shown with :kbd:`LMB` click on the button.
The selected option is then shown as active on the menu button.

.. _bpy.types.UIPopupMenu:

Pop-Up Menus
============

.. figure:: /images/interface_controls_buttons_menus_popup-menu.png
   :align: right
   :width: 200px
   :figwidth: 200px

   The Transform Orientations pop-up menu.

Pop-up menus are overlays.
Like Select Menus, pop-up menus also include down arrow on the right
side of menu button. However, pop-up menus allow more content to be shown,
such as title, list options, buttons, sliders, etc.
Pop-up menus group controls into a menu, which is automatically hidden
when mouse pointer leaves menu boundaries (including a margin).

If pop-up menu content is too large to fit on the screen, small menu
scrolling indicator triangle appears on bottom or top of menu.
Scrolling is done by moving the mouse below or above the scrolling indicator.

Mouse selection
   :kbd:`LMB` on the desired item.
Numerical selection
   You can use the number keys or numpad to input an item in the list to select.
   For example, :kbd:`Numpad1` will select the first item and so on.

Pop-ups can be moved by dragging their title.

.. todo <2.8 duplicate: selection


Shortcuts
---------

- Use :kbd:`Wheel` while hovering with the mouse.
- Arrow keys can be used to navigate.
- Each menu item has an underlined character which can be pressed to activate it.
- Number keys or numpad can be used to access menu items.
  (Where :kbd:`1` is the first menu item, :kbd:`2` the second, etc.
  For larger menus :kbd:`Alt-1` the 11th... up to :kbd:`Alt-0` the 20th).
- Press :kbd:`Return` to activate the selected menu item.
- Press :kbd:`Esc` to cancel the menu, or move the mouse cursor far from the pop-up,
  or by :kbd:`LMB` clicking anywhere out of it.


Context Menu
============

Context menus are pop-ups opened with the :kbd:`RMB`.
Context menu contents depend on the location of the mouse pointer.
However, common options include:

.. for the property associated with the control.

Single
   Set or get single value.
All
   Include all combinations.
Reset All/Single to Default Value(s)
   Replaces the current value by the default (keyboard shortcut :kbd:`Backspace`).
Unset
   TODO.
Copy Data Path
   Copies the Python property Data path, relative to the data-block.
   Useful for Python scripting.
Copy To Selected
   Copies the property value to the selected object's corresponding property.
   A use case is if the Properties editor context is pinned.
Assign Shortcut
   Lets you define a keyboard or mouse shortcut for an operation.
   To define the shortcut you must first move the mouse cursor over the button that pops up,
   and when "Press a key" appears you must press and/or click the desired shortcut.
   Press :kbd:`Esc` to cancel.
Change Shortcut
   Lets you redefine the shortcut.
Remove Shortcut

.. _ui-specials-menu:

Specials Menu
=============

The Specials pop-up menu contains a context-sensitive list of operators.
It is opened by a button with a down arrow on dark background |specials-button| or
:kbd:`W` in most editors giving quick access to tools sensitive to the editor's mode.


.. _bpy.types.UIPieMenu:

Pie Menus
=========

A pie menu is a menu whose items are spread radially around the mouse.
Pie menus have to be activated in the User Preferences through
:menuselection:`Add-ons --> UI --> Pie Menus Official/ 3D Viewport Pie Menus`.

.. figure:: /images/interface_controls_buttons_menus_pie-menu.png

   The 3D Viewport Mode Pie menu.


Interaction
-----------

The pie menu is spawned by a key press,
which are listed in the add-on's documentation.

.. tip::

   Fastest way to operate a Pie menu is to press down key(s) that
   invoke the menu, then move mouse slightly towards a selection, and
   release key(s) to activate the selection.

Releasing the key without moving the mouse will keep the menu open and
the user can then move the mouse pointer towards the direction of a pie menu item and select it by clicking.
Releasing the key, after moving the mouse towards a pie menu item, will cause the menu to close and
the selected menu item to activate.

An open disc widget at the center of the pie menu shows
the current direction of the pie menu. The selected item is also highlighted.
A pie menu will only have a valid direction for item selection,
if the mouse is touching or extending beyond the disc widget at the center of the menu.

Pie menu items support key accelerators, which are the letters underlined on each menu item.
Also number keys can be used to select the items.

If there are sub-pies available, it is indicated by a plus icon.

See :ref:`Pie menu settings <prefs-pie-menu>`.
