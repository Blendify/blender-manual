   Toggle Buttons.

These buttons are used to activate or deactivate options. Use :kbd:`LMB` to change its state.

On checkboxes a tick is shown when the option is activated.
Toggle buttons are used to set an on/off status. When state is on, they appear like pressed (dark).
Clicking this type of button will toggle a state but will not perform any operation.
Some toggle buttons have an icon version for each state.


Dragging
--------

To change many value at once, you can :kbd:`LMB` drag over multiple buttons,
This works for checkboxes, toggles and to select a radio button value.

.. tip::

   For layer buttons (a type of toggle button) it is often useful to hold :kbd:`Shift` at the same time,
   to set or clear many layers at once.


Radio Buttons
=============

Radio buttons are used to choose from a small selection of "mutually exclusive" options.


Cycling
-------

Use :kbd:`Ctrl-Wheel`, while hovering with the mouse over it, to cycle between the the options.
Cycling works also for number button and select menus.
