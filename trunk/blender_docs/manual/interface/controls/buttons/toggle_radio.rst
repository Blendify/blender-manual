Check Boxes & Toggle Buttons
============================

   Check boxes and Toggle buttons.

These controls are used to activate or deactivate options. Use
:kbd:`LMB` to change their state. A tick is shown on check boxes when
the option is activated. Active status on toggle buttons is indicated
either by color on the icon background, or a change in icon graphics.

.. tip::
   
   To change many values at once on or off, you can press down
   :kbd:`LMB` and drag over multiple buttons. This works for check
   boxes, toggles and to select a radio button value.

   Use :kbd:`Ctrl-Wheel`, while hovering with the mouse over radio
   buttons, to cycle between the options.
