Eyedropper
**********

The eyedropper (pipette icon) allows you to sample from anywhere in the Blender window.
The eyedropper can be used to select different kinds of data:

Color
   This is the most common usage.
Objects/Object-Data
   This is used with object buttons such as parent, constraints or modifiers to
   select an object from the 3D View.
Camera Depth
   Number buttons effecting distance can also use the eye-dropper.

   This is used to set the cameras depth of field so the depth chosen is in focus.

- :kbd:`E` will activate the eye-dropper while hovering over a button.
- :kbd:`LMB` dragging will mix the colors you drag over, which can help when sampling noisy imagery.
- :kbd:`Spacebar` resets and starts mixing the colors again.
