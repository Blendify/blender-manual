At the bottom of a list view (like the ones found in the object data properties)
there are controls for filtering and sorting and resizing.

Select
   To select an item, :kbd:`LMB` on it.
Rename
   By double clicking on an item, you can edit its name via a text field.
   This can also be achieved by pressing :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` over it.
Resize
   The list view can be resized to show more or fewer items.
   Hover the mouse over the handle (==) then click and drag the handle to expand or shrink the list.
Filter
   Click the *Show filtering options* button (+) to toggle filter option buttons.

   Search
      Type part of a list item's name in the filter text box to filter items by part of their name.

   Filter Include
      When the magnifying glass icon has a ``+`` sign then only items that match the text will be displayed.
   Filter Exclude
      When the magnifying glass icon has a ``-`` sign then only items that do not match text will be displayed.

   Sort
      Sort list items.

      Alphabetical
         This button switches between alphabetical and non-alphabetical ordering.
      Inverse
         Sort objects in ascending or descending order. This also applies to alphabetical sorting, if selected.


One the right of the list view are additional buttons:

Add ``+``
   Adds a new item.
Remove ``-``
   To remove the selected item.
Specials
   The down arrow on dark background opens a pop-up menu with
   operators context-sensitive to the item type.
   i.e. copy paste, or operations on all items.

Move Up
   The button showing an up arrow moves the selected item up one position.
Move Down
   The down arrow moves the item down.
