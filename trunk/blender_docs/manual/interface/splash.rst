   These options can always be changed later in the :doc:`Preferences </editors/preferences/index>`

Shortcuts
   Presets for the default :doc:`keymap </editors/preferences/keymap>` for Blender.
   Note that this manual assumes that you use the "Blender" keymap.

      This is the default keymap.

      and is designed for people upgrading who do not want to learn the updated keymap.

      and is intended for people who use many different creation software.
