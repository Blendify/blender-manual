Quick Set Up
============

When you open Blender for the first time the interactive region of the splash screen
is replaced with a couple initial preferences to configure how you interact inside Blender.

.. note::

   These options can always be changed later in the :doc:`Preferences </editors/preferences/index>`

Shortcuts
   Presets for the default :doc:`keymap </editors/preferences/keymap>` for Blender.
   Note that this manual assumes that you use the "Blender" keymap.

   Blender
      This is the default keymap.
      Read more about this keymap :doc:`here </interface/keymap/blender_default>`
   Blender 2.7x
      This keymap is intended to match the last major series of Blender versions
      and is designed for people upgrading who do not want to learn the updated keymap.
   Industry Compatible
      This keymap is indented to match common creation software
      and is intended for people who use many different creation software.
      Read more about this keymap :doc:`here </interface/keymap/industry_compatible>`

Select With
   Controls which mouse button, either right or left, is used to select items in Blender.

   These and other shortcuts can be modified in the :doc:`keymap preferences </editors/preferences/keymap>`.
