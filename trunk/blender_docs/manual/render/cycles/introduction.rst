Cycles is Blender's physically-based production renderer.

To use Cycles, set it as the active render engine in the Info editor's header.
Interactive rendering can be started by setting a 3D View editor to draw mode Rendered using :kbd:`Shift-Z`.
To perform a full render go to :menuselection:`Properties --> Render`
here you can either choose to render a still image or an :doc:`Animation </render/workflows/animations>`.

Cycles may be able to use your :abbr:`GPU (Graphics Processing Unit, or Graphics Card)` for faster rendering.
To see if and how you can use your GPU for rendering, see the documentation on
:doc:`GPU Rendering </render/cycles/gpu_rendering>`.

The source code is available under the Apache License v2,
and can be integrated in open source and commercial software.
Cycles is natively integrated in Blender, Poser, and Rhino.
