Surface
=======

Multiple Importance Sample
   By default objects with emitting materials use both direct and indirect light sampling methods,
   but in some cases it may lead to less noise overall to disable direct light sampling for some materials.
   This can be done by disabling the *Multiple Importance Sample* option.
   This is especially useful on large objects that emit little light compared to other light sources.

   This option will only have an influence if the material contains an emission node;
   it will be automatically disabled otherwise.

Transparent Shadows
   Use transparent shadows if it contains a :doc:`Transparent BSDF </>`,
   disabling will render faster but will not give accurate shadows.


Volume
======

Sampling Method
   Options are "Multiple Importance", "Distance" or "Equiangular".
   If you've got a pretty dense volume that is lit from far away then distance sampling is usually more efficient.
   If you've got a light inside or near the volume then equiangular sampling is better.
   If you have a combination of both, then the multiple importance sampling will be better.

Interpolation
   TODO.

Homogeneous Volume
   Assume volume has the same density everywhere (not using any textures), for faster rendering.
   For example absorption in a glass object would typically not have any textures,
   and by knowing this we can avoid taking small steps to sample the volume shader.
