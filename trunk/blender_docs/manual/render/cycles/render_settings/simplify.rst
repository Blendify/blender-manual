.. rubric:: Common Settings

Max Subdivision
   Maximum number of subdivision by the subdivision surface modifiers.
Child Particles
   Show only a subset of all child hairs and particles.
Texture Limit
   Automatically scales textures down so that they are no larger than the values chosen.
   This can help reduce computer memory resources when rendering large scenes with huge textures.
AO Bounces
   Replace global illumination with ambient occlusion after the specified number of bounces.
   This can reduce noise in interior scenes with little visual difference.
