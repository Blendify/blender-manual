   Velvet Node.

It is meant to be used together with other shaders (such as a *Diffuse Shader*)
and isn't particularly useful on it's own.


Inputs
======

Color

Sigma
   Variance of the normal distribution,
   controlling the sharpness of the peak - can be thought of as a kind of *roughness*.
Normal
   Normal used for shading; if nothing is connected the default shading normal is used.


Properties
==========

This node has no properties.


Outputs
