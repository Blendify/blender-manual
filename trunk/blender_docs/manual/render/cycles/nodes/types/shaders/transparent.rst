   Transparent Node.

The *Transparent* :abbr:`BSDF (Bidirectional scattering distribution function)`
node is used to add trancperency without refraction, passing straight through the surface,
as if there were no geometry there. Useful with alpha maps, for example.
This shader :ref:`affects light paths somewhat differently <render-cycles-light-paths-transparency>`
than other :abbr:`BSDF (Bidirectional scattering distribution function)`\ s.
Note that only pure white transparent shaders are completely transparent.


Inputs
======

Color
   Color of the surface, or physically speaking,
   the probability for each wavelength that light is blocked or passes straight through the surface.


Properties
==========

This node has no properties.


Outputs
=======

BSDF
   Standard shader output.
