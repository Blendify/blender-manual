   Object Info Node.


The *Object Info* node gives information about the object instance.
This can be useful to give some variation to a single material assigned to multiple instances,
either manually controlled through the object index, based on the object location,
or randomized for each instance. For example a Noise texture can give random colors or a Color
ramp can give a range of colors to be randomly picked from.
