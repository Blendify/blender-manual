   Attribute Node.


The *Attribute Node* allows you to retrieve attributes attached to an object or mesh.
Currently, the following are the most important ones that you will need to know:

:Vertex Color Layers: These can be retrieved this by their names.
:density: gives a scalar defining the density of any smoke inside the
   :doc:`Smoke Domain </physics/smoke/types/domain>`.
:flame: gives a scalar defining the density of any fire inside the :doc:`Smoke Domain </physics/smoke/types/domain>`.
   All three outputs are the same.
:color: gives the color of the smoke inside the :doc:`Smoke Domain </physics/smoke/types/domain>`.
   The color and vector outputs are the same. The fac output is an average of the channels.
:Ocean Foam: Gives a scalar define where foam might apear when using an
   :doc:`Ocean Modifier </modeling/modifiers/simulate/ocean>`.
   This depends on the name you give this property.
