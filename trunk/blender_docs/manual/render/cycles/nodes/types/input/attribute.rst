   Attribute Node.

The *Attribute* node allows you to retrieve attributes attached to an object or mesh.


Inputs
======

This node has no inputs.


Properties
==========

Name
   Name of the attribute. Currently, the following are the most important ones that you will need to know:

   Vertex Color Layers
      These can be retrieved this by their names.
   Density
      Gives a scalar defining the density of any smoke inside
      the :doc:`Smoke Domain </physics/smoke/types/domain>`.
   Flame
      Gives a scalar defining the density of any fire inside the :doc:`Smoke Domain </physics/smoke/types/domain>`.
      All three outputs are the same.
   Color
      Gives the color of the smoke inside the :doc:`Smoke Domain </physics/smoke/types/domain>`.
      The color and vector outputs are the same. The Factor output is an average of the channels.
   Ocean Foam
      Gives a scalar defining where foam might appear when using
      an :doc:`Ocean Modifier </modeling/modifiers/simulate/ocean>`.
      This depends on the name you give this property.
