   Musgrave Texture Node.

The *Musgrave Texture* is used to add an advanced procedural noise texture.

Musgrave is a type of *Fractal Noise*.
Simple *Perlin Noise* is generated multiple times with different scaling,
and the results are combined in different ways depending on the Musgrave type.
This results in a detailed texture with self-similar appearance at different scales, like fractals.


Inputs
======

Vector
   Texture coordinate to sample texture at;
   defaults to *Generated* texture coordinates if the socket is left unconnected.
Scale
   Overall texture scale.
Detail
   Controls how many instances of base noise texture are combined.
   Each extra instance is scaled and brings more small details.
Dimension
   Controls the intensity of the different instances of base noise.
   Setting it to zero will use the same intensities for all noise instances.
   Larger values will reduce the intensity of finer (larger-scaled) instances,
   making smaller details less visible.
Lacunarity
   Controls the scale of the different instances of base noise.
   This is a factor for scaling each further instance, relative to the previous one,
   i.e. the scales grow exponentially. When setting it to 1 all instances have the same scale.
Offset
   This value is added to each noise instance, determines the level where least fine noise will appear.
   It only has an effect for *Hybrid Multifractal*, *Ridged Multifractal* and *Hetero Terrain*.
Gain
   An extra multiplier to change the intensity of finer noise instances.
   It only has an effect for *Hybrid Multifractal* and *Ridged Multifractal*.


Properties
==========

Type
   Specifies different methods to combine the multiple noise instances.
   Originally, the algorithms for generating procedural terrain.

   fBM (fractal Brownian Motion)
      Produces a non-natural homogeneous and isotropic result.
      Uses a additive cascade, the values are simply added together. 
   Multifractal
      The result is more uneven (varies with location), more similar to the real terrain.
      Uses a multiplicative cascade.
   Hybrid Multifractal
      Creates peaks and valleys with different roughnesses, like real mountains rise out of flat plains.
      Combines the additive cascade with the multiplicative cascade.
   Ridged Multifractal
      Creates sharp peaks. Calculates the absolute value of noise,
      creating "canyons", and then flips the surface upside down.
   Hetero Terrain (Heterogeneous Terrain)
      Similar to *Hybrid Multifractal* creates heterogeneous terrain, but with the likeness of a river channels.


Outputs
=======

Color
   Texture color output.
   It is grayscale, all three RGB components are equal to the value of the *Factor* output.
Factor
   Texture intensity output.

.. tip::

   The *Musgrave Texture* often needs some adjustments (e.g. by multiplication and addition)
   in order to avoid clipping and see more detail.
