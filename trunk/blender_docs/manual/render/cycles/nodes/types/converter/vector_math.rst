   Vector Math Node.


This node performs the selected math operation on vectors.
Select the math function by clicking the up-down selector where the "Add" selection is shown.


Inputs
======

Vector
   Input vector 1 (upper). The value can be provided by another node or set manually.
Vector
   Input vector 2 (lower). The value can be provided by another node or set manually.


Properties
==========

Operation
   Selector the math function for conversion.

   Add
      Adding input 1 and 2.
   Subtract
      Subtracting input 1 and 2.
   Average
      Averaging input 1 and 2.
   Dot Product
      Algebraic operation that takes two equal-length sequences of vectors 1 and 2 and returns a single number.
      Result - scalar.
   Cross Product
      Geometric binary operation on two vectors 1 and 2 in three-dimensional space.
      It results in a vector which is perpendicular to both and therefore normal to the plane containing them.
      Result - vector.
   Normalize
      Normalizing input 1 and 2.


Outputs
=======

Vector
   Output vector, converted by the node.
Value
   Output value, converted by the node.


Example
=======

Todo.
