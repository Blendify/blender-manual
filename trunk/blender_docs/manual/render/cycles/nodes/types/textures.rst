Image Texture
=============

.. figure:: /images/cycles_nodes_tex_image.jpg
   :width: 200px

   Image texture from `GoodTextures.com <https://www.goodtextures.com/>`__


Use an image file as a texture.

Image Data-Block
   Image data-block used as the image source. Currently not all images supported by Blender can be used by Cycles.
   In particular, generated, packed images or animations are not supported currently.
Projection
   Projection to use for mapping the textures.

   - *Flat* will use the XY coordinates for mapping.
   - *Box* will map the image to the 6 sides of a virtual box, based on the normal,
     using XY, YZ and XYZ coordinates depending on the side.
   - *Sphere* will map the image to the sphere using Z axis as central.
   - *Tube* will map the tube to the sphere using Z axis as central.

Projection Blend
   For Box mapping, the amount to blend between sides of the box,
   to get rid of sharp transitions between the different sides.
   Blending is useful to map a procedural-like image texture pattern seamlessly on a model. 0.0 gives no blending;
   higher values give a smoother transition.
Color Space
   Type of data that the image contains, either Color or Non-Color Data.
   For most color textures the default of Color should be used, but in case of e.g. a bump or alpha map,
   the pixel values should be interpreted as Non-Color Data, to avoid doing any unwanted color space conversions.
Extension Type
   Extension type defines how the image is extrapolated past the original bounds:

   - *Repeat* will repeat the image horizontally and vertically giving tiled-looking result.
   - *Extend* will extend the image by repeating pixels on it's edges.
   - *Clip* will set all the extended pixels values to transparent black.

Vector input
   Texture coordinate for texture lookup. If this socket is left unconnected,
   UV coordinates from the active UV render layer are used.
Color output
   RGB color from image. If the image has alpha, the color is premultiplied with alpha if the Alpha output is used,
   and unpremultiplied or straight if the Alpha output is not used.
Alpha output
   Alpha channel from image.


Environment Texture
===================

Environmental textures are used to light your scene using an environment map image file as a texture.

Image Data-Block
   Image data-block used as the image source.
Color Space
   Type of data that the image contains, either Color or Non-Color Data.
   For most color textures the default of Color should be used, but in case of e.g. a bump or alpha map,
   the pixel values should be interpreted as Non-Color Data, to avoid doing any unwanted color space conversions.
Texture Interpolation
   Interpolation method used for the environment texture. The following interpolations are available:

   :Linear: Default.
   :Closest: No interpolation.
   :Cubic: Only available when rendering on the CPU.
   :Smart: Bicubic when magnifying else Bilinear is used. This is only available for :doc:`OSL </render/cycles/osl>`.
