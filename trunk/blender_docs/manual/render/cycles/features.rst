Experimental Features
=======================
Experimental features are disabled / hidden by default, but can be enabled by setting *Feature Set* to
*Experimental* in the Render properties.
They may not work properly, crash Blender or change their behaviour in later versions.

.. warning:: The experimental GPU kernel requires a lot of memory
             and thus may not work at all on cards without enough ram.
