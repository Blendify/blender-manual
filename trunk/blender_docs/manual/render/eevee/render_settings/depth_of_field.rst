Depth of Field

Depth of field is done as a post-process in Eevee.

The depth of field effect is using the same :doc:`camera </render/cameras>` settings as Cycles.

.. note::

   Depth of Field only works in Camera View.

Max Size
   Max size of the bokeh shape for the depth of field (lower is faster).

   .. note::

      Because of performance considerations, the viewport can exhibit color artifacts when using large bokeh sizes.
      These artifacts are not present in the final render.
