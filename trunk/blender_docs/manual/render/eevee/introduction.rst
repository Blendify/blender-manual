Eevee is Blender's realtime render engine built within Blender using OpenGL focused on
speed and interactivity while achieving the goal of previewing :abbr:`PBR <Physically Based Rendering>` materials.
It is designed to be a viewport engine but also offers high quality output for final render.

Eevee also powers the lookdev mode (TODO link).
