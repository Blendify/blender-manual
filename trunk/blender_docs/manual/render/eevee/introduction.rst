Eevee is Blender's realtime render engine built within Blender using :term:`OpenGL` focused on
speed and interactivity while achieving the goal of previewing :abbr:`PBR (Physically Based Rendering)` materials.
It is designed to be a viewport engine but also offers high quality output for final render.

Eevee also powers the LookDev mode (TODO2.8 link).
