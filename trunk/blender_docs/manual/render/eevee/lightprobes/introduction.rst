Probe objects are used by Eevee as support objects. They records lighting information locally in order to lit the scene using indirect lighting.

There is 3 different probe types. One for diffuse light lighting two for specular lighting.

This types of objects are only usefull for Eevee (and by extension, the Lookdev mode). They are meant to guide the engine to compute better lighting faster.
