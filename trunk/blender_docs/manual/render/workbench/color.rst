Single
   Render the whole scene using a single color. The color can be chosen.

Object
   Use the color that can be set per object
   in the Viewport Display :ref:`properties-object-viewport-display` panel.

Material
   Use the color that can be set per material
   in the Viewport Display :ref:`properties-material-viewport-display` panel.

Random
   A random color will be selected for every object in the scene.

   no active vertex colors it will be rendered in the color that is set
   in the Viewport Display :ref:`properties-material-viewport-display` panel.

Texture

   the object will be rendered with the settings

   .. note::

      The *Texture* option is not available when :doc:`/render/workbench/lighting` is set to *MatCap*.
