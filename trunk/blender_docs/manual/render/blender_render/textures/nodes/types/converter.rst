***********************
Texture Convertor Nodes
***********************

As the name implies, these nodes convert the colors in the material in some way.


Math
====

.. figure:: /images/texture-nodes_math.jpg

   math node.


The math node performs one of several math functions on one or two inputs

Clamp
   Clamps the result between 0 and 1.

Add
   Add the two inputs
Subtract
   Subtract input 2 from input 1
Multiply
   Multiply the two inputs
Divide
   Divide input 1 by input 2
Sine
   The sine of input 1 (degrees)
Cosine
   The cosine of input 1 (degrees)
Tangent
   The tangent of input 1 (degrees)
Arcsine
   The arcsine (inverse sine) of input 1 (degrees)
Arccosine
   The arccosine (inverse cosine) of input 1 (degrees)
Arctangent
   The arctangent (inverse tangent) of input 1 (degrees)
Power
   Input 1 to the power of input 2 (input1^input2)
Logarithm
   log base input 2 of input 1
Minimum
   The minimum of input 1 and input 2
Maximum
   The maximum of input 1 and input 2
Round
   Rounds input 1 to the nearest integer
Less Than
   Test if input 1 is less than input 2, returns 1 for true, 0 for false
Greater Than
   Test if input 1 is greater than input 2, returns 1 for true, 0 for false


ColorRamp Node
==============

.. figure:: /images/texture-nodes-colorRamp.jpg

   ColorRamp Node.


The ColorRamp Node is used for mapping values to colors with the use of a gradient.
It works exactly the same way as a
:doc:`Colorband for textures and materials </render/blender_render/materials/properties/ramps>`,
using the Factor value as a slider or index to the color ramp shown,
and outputting a color value and an alpha value from the output sockets.

By default,
the ColorRamp is added to the node map with two colors at opposite ends of the spectrum.
A completely black black is on the left
(Black as shown in the swatch with an Alpha value of 1.00)
and a whitewash white is on the right.

See :ref:`ui-color_ramp_widget` for editing info.


RGB to BW Node
==============

.. figure:: /images/texture-nodes-rgbToBw.jpg

   RGB to BW Node.


This node converts a color image to black-and-white by computing the luminance of the rgb
values.


Value to Normal
===============

.. figure:: /images/texture-nodes-valueToNormal.jpg

   Value to Normal node.


Computes a normal map based on greyscale values of an input

Val
   The texture to compute the normal map from

Nabla
   Size of derivative offset used for calculating normals.


Distance
========

.. figure:: /images/texture-nodes-distance.jpg

   Distance node. Coordinate 2 dropdown is displayed.


Computes the distance between two 3d coordinates.
