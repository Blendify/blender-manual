Assigning a Texture
*******************

This page just shows how to add a texture to a slot.
The textures' commons options are explained :doc:`here </render/blender_render/textures/options>`.


Choosing the Texture context

   Texture panel


In the Properties editor, choose the Texture context: this will show the Texture panel.


Choosing the Texture data type
==============================

The three buttons *Material*, *World*,
*Brush* at the top of the texture panel indicate the texture data type, that is,
the kind of texture that is being edited.

Textures Slots
==============

   :figwidth: 300px

   Texture panel


The list below these buttons represent the *Stack* of textures that we can manage.
It can have up to eighteen *Texture Slots*:


- Tick or untick a texture to enable/disable it.
- Use the three buttons on the right side to move individual textures
  up and down in the stack or to copy/paste material's settings between slots.


Creating a new Texture Datablock in a new Texture Slot
======================================================

Select an empty slot, then click on the *New* button.

This will do two things:

- it will create a new texture datablock
- also, it will add a new slot in the textures stack


Creating a new Texture Datablock in a non-empty slot
====================================================

Select a non-empty slot, then click on the *Plus* button.

This will do two things:

- it will create a new texture datablock, with a new name,
  **making a copy of the texture datablock assigned to the selected slot**
- it will assign this new datablock to the selected slot


Sharing a Texture Datablock in a non-empty slot
===============================================

- Select a non-empty slot, then click on the *Browse* button.
  This will open a menu showing all the available Texture Datablocks in this file.
- Choose a texture datablock in the menu to assign it to the selected slot.
  This will share the chosen texture with more than one object,
  hence the *Number of users* shown in the texture datablock will increase by one.
