Technical Details
=================

Generation
   Bands are generated based on a sine formula. You can also add a degree of turbulence with the Noise formula.
Coordinates
   As the band is based on a sine formula, the texture repeats itself every pi units rather than every 1.0 units.
   To correct this, scale the texture by a value of pi for the dimension you wish.
