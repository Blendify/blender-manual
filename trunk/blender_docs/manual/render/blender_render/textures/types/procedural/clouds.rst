Clouds

Clouds represent Perlin noise. In addition, each noise-based Blender texture
(with the exception of Voronoi and simple noise) has a "Noise Basis" setting that allows the
user to select which algorithm is used to generate the texture. This is often used for
Clouds, Fire, Smoke. Well-suited to be used as a Bump map, giving an overall irregularity to the material.
