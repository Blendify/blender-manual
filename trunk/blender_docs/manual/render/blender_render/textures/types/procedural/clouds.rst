   Clouds Texture Panels.


Clouds represent Perlin noise. In addition, each noise-based Blender texture
(with the exception of Voronoi and simple noise) has a "Noise Basis" setting that allows the
user to select which algorithm is used to generate the texture.

Often used for
   Clouds, Fire, Smoke. Well-suited to be used as a Bump map, giving an overall irregularity to the material.
Result(s)
   *Greyscale* (default) or RGB *Color*


Options
=======

Greyscale
   The standard noise, gives an intensity
Color
   The noise gives an RGB value
Noise
   *Soft* or *Hard*, changes contrast and sharpness
Size
   The dimension of the Noise table
Depth
   The depth of the *Clouds* calculation.
   A higher number results in a long calculation time, but also in finer details.
