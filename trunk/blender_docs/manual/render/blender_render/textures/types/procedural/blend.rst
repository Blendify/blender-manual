Blend
*****

The Blend texture generates a smoothly interpolated progression.
This is one of the most frequently used procedural textures.
You can use blend textures to blend other textures together (with *Stencil*),
or to create nice effects (especially with the *Mapping: Normal* trick).

.. note::

   Remember that if you use a ramp to create a custom blending, you may have to use *No RGB*,
   if the *Mapping* value needs an intensity input.
