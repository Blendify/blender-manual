   Blend Texture Panels


Often used for
   This is one of the most frequently used procedural textures.
   You can use blend textures to blend other textures together (with *Stencil*),
   or to create nice effects (especially with the *Mapping: Normal* trick).
   Just remember: if you use a ramp to create a custom blending, you may have to use *No RGB*,
   if the *Mapping* value needs an intensity input.
Result(s)
   Intensity. The Blend texture generates a smoothly interpolated progression.
