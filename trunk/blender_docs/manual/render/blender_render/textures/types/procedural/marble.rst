Bands are generated based on the sine, saw, or triangular formula and noise turbulence.

Noise Type
   The noise function works with two methods.

   Soft, Hard
Size
   The dimensions of the noise table.
Depth
   The depth of the *Marble* calculation.
   A higher value results in greater calculation time, but also in finer details.
