   Vector Math node.


This node performs vector math operation.


Inputs
======

Vector
   First vector input.
Vector
   Second vector input.


Properties
==========

Operation
   Selector of the math function.

   Add
      Adding input 1 and 2.
   Subtract
      Subtracting input 1 and 2.
   Average
      Averaging input 1 and 2.
   Dot Product
      Algebraic operation that takes two equal-length sequences of input vectors.
      The result is a scalar value.
   Cross Product
      Geometric binary operation on the two vectors inputs in three-dimensional space.
      It results in a vector which is perpendicular to both and therefore normal to the plane containing them.
   Normalize
      Normalizing input 1 and 2.


Outputs
=======

Vector
   Standard vector output.
Value
   Standard value output.
