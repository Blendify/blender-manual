Convertor Nodes
***************

As the name implies, these nodes convert the colors in the material in some way.


ColorRamp Node
==============

.. figure:: /images/Material-Convertor-Node-ColorRamp.jpg

   ColorRamp node


The ColorRamp Node is used for mapping values to colors with the use of a gradient.
It works exactly the same way as a
:doc:`Colorband for textures and materials </render/blender_render/materials/properties/ramps>`,
using the Factor value as a slider or index to the color ramp shown,
and outputting a color value and an alpha value from the output sockets.

By default,
the ColorRamp is added to the node map with two colors at opposite ends of the spectrum.
A completely black black is on the left
(Black as shown in the swatch with an Alpha value of 1.00)
and a whitewash white is on the right.

To select a color, :kbd:`LMB` click on the thin vertical line/band within the colorband.
The example picture shows the black color selected, as it is highlighted white.
The settings for the color are shown above the colorband as (left to right): color swatch,
Alpha setting, and interpolation type.


Inputs
------

Fac:
   Factor. The degree of node's influence in node tree. The value can be provided by another node or set manually.


Outputs
-------

Color
   Value of the color, combined by the node.
Alpha
   Value of the alpha, combined by the node.


Controls
--------

   Colorband


Colorband
   Contain a gradient through a sequence of many colors (with alpha),
   each color acting across a certain position in the spectrum.


.. figure:: /images/Material-Convertor-Node-ColorRamp-Numberpoint-Buticon.jpg

   The number of the active mark.


.. figure:: /images/Material-Convertor-Node-ColorRamp-Pospoint-Buticon.jpg

   *Pos*. The position of the active color mark in the colorband (range 0.0â€“1.0).
   The position of the color marks can also be changed by :kbd:`LMB` dragging them in the colorband.

Separate RGB Node
=================

.. figure:: /images/Material-Convertor-Node-SeparateRGB.jpg

   Separate RGB node

This node separates an image into its red, green and blue channels.
The colors are then converted to intensity, which returns a greyscale to the output.
For example, if you have an image with pure green,
then the red and blue outputs will be black and the green output will be completely white.
Mixed colors will return mixed values according to their RGB intensity.   


Inputs
------

Image
   Input color value. Includes a color swatch, allowing you to select the color directly on the node.


Outputs
-------

R
   Value of the red color channel, separated out by the node.
G
   Value of the green color channel, separated out by the node.
B
   Value of the blue color channel, separated out by the node.


Combine RGB Node
================

.. figure:: /images/Material-Convertor-Node-CombineRGB.jpg

   Combine RGB node


This node combines a color (image) from separated red, green, blue channels.


Inputs
------

R
   Input value of red color channel. The value can be provided by another node or set manually.
G
   Input value of green color channel. The value can be provided by another node or set manually.
B
   Input value of blue color channel. The value can be provided by another node or set manually.


Outputs
-------

   Output value of the color, combined by the node.


Separate HSV Node
=================

.. figure:: /images/Material-Convertor-Node-SeparateHSV.jpg

   Separate HSV node


This node separates an image into image maps for the hue, saturation, value channels.
Three values, often considered as more intuitive than the RGB system
(nearly only used on computers)

Use and manipulate the separated channels for different purposes; i.e.
to achieve some compositing/color adjustment result. For example,
you could expand the Value channel (by using the multiply node)
to make all the colors brighter. You could make an image more relaxed by diminishing
(via the divide or map value node) the Saturation channel.
You could isolate a specific range of colors
(by clipping the Hue channel via the Colorramp node) and change their color
(by the Add/Subtract mix node).


Inputs
------

Color
   Input color value. Includes a color swatch, allowing you to select the color directly on the node.


Outputs
-------

H
   Value of the **hue** color channel, separated out by the node (choose a color of the rainbow).
S
   Value of the saturation color channel,
   separated out by the node (the *quantity* of hue in the color
   (from desaturate - shade of gray - to saturate - brighter colors)).
V
   Value of the value color channel,
   separated out by the node (the **luminosity** of the color
   (from 'no light' - black - to 'full light' - 'full' color, or white if Saturation is 0.0)).


Combine HSV Node
