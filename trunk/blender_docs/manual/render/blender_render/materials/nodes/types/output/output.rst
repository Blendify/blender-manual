   Output material node.


At any point, you may want to see the work in progress,
especially right after some operation by a node. Simply create another thread from the output
socket of the node to the picture input socket of an Output node to see a mini-picture.

Connect the alpha channel to set/see transparency.


.. note:: Effective Output Node

   The only Output node that is used for the Material in the end
   (i.e the only non-Preview) has a little *red sphere* on the upper right.
