A diffuse shader determines, simply speaking,
the general color of a material when light shines on it. Most shaders that are designed to
mimic reality give a smooth falloff from bright to dark from the point of the strongest
illumination to the shadowed areas,
but Blender also has other shaders for various special effects.


Common Options
==============

All diffuse shaders have the following options:

Color
   Select the base *diffuse color* of the material.
Intensity
   The shader's brightness, or more accurately,
   the amount of incident light energy that is actually diffusely reflected towards the camera.
Ramp
   Allows you to set a range of colors for the *Material*, and define how the range will vary over a surface.
   See :doc:`Color Ramps </render/blender_render/materials/properties/ramps>` for details.


Technical Details
=================

Light striking a surface and then re-irradiated via a Diffusion phenomenon will be scattered, i.e.,
re-irradiated in all directions isotropically. This means that the camera will see the same amount of light from that
surface point no matter what the *incident viewing angle* is.
It is this quality that makes diffuse light *viewpoint independent*. Of course,
the amount of light that strikes the surface depends on the incident light angle.
If most of the light striking a surface is reflected diffusely, the surface will have a matte appearance
(Light re-irradiated in the diffusion phenomenon).

.. tip:: Shader Names

   Some shaders' names may sound odd -
   they are traditionally named after the people who first introduced the models on which they are based.

   Lambert Shader.


This is Blender's default diffuse shader, and is a good general all-around workhorse for
materials showing low levels of specular reflection.

`Johann Heinrich Lambert <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Heinrich_Lambert>`__ (1728-1777)
   was a Swiss mathematician, physicist and astronomer who published works on the reflection of light,
   most notably the `Beer-Lambert Law <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer%E2%80%93Lambert_law>`__
   which formulates the law of light absorption.

This shader has only the default option, determining how much of available light is reflected.
Default is 0.8, to allow other objects to be brighter.

   Oren-Nayar Shader.


Oren-Nayar takes a somewhat more 'physical' approach to the diffusion phenomena as it takes
into account the amount of microscopic roughness of the surface.
`Michael Oren <https://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/o/Oren:Michael.html>`__ and
`Shree K. Nayar <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shree_K._Nayar>`__
Their `reflectance model <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oren%E2%80%93Nayar_reflectance_model>`__,
developed in the early 1990s, is a generalization of Lambert's law now widely used in computer graphics.


Options
-------

Roughness
   The roughness of the surface, and hence, the amount of diffuse scattering.

   Toon Shader Variations.


The Toon shader is a very 'un-physical' shader in that it is not meant to fake reality but to
produce cartoon cel styled rendering,
with clear boundaries between light and shadow and uniformly lit/shadowed regions.


Options
-------

Size
   The size of the lit area
Smooth
   The softness of the boundary between lit and shadowed areas

   Minnaert Shader.


Minnaert works by darkening parts of the standard Lambertian shader,
so if *Dark* is 1 you get exactly the Lambertian result.
Higher darkness values will darken the center of an object
(where it points towards the viewer).
Lower darkness values will lighten the edges of the object, making it look somewhat velvet.
`Marcel Minnaert <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Minnaert>`__ (1893-1970)
was a Belgian astronomer interested in the effects of the atmosphere on light and images who in 1954 published a book
entitled "The Nature of Light and Color in the Open Air".


Options
-------

Dark
   The darkness of the 'lit' areas (higher) or the darkness of the edges pointing away from the light source (lower).

   Fresnel Shader, Different Spec.


With a Fresnel shader the amount of diffuse reflected light depends on the incidence angle, i.
e. from the direction of the light source.
Areas pointing directly towards the light source appear darker;
areas perpendicular to the incoming light become brighter.
`Augustin-Jean Fresnel <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin-Jean_Fresnel>`__ (1788-1827)
was a French physicist who contributed significantly to the establishment of the theory of wave optics.


Options
-------

Fresnel
   Power of the Fresnel effect, 5.0 is max.
Factor
   Blending factor of the Fresnel factor to blend in, 5.0 is max.

Emit
   Amount of light to emit
Ambient
   Amount of global ambient color the material receives
Translucency
   Amount of diffuse shading on the back side
Shadeless
   Make this material insensitive to light or shadow
Tangent Shading
   Use the material's tangent vector instead of the normal for shading&nbsp;&mdash;
   for anisotropic shading effects (e.g. soft hair and brushed metal).

Cubic Interpolation
   Use cubic interpolation for diffuse values, for smoother transitions between light areas and dark areas.
