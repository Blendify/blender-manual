   Panel Physics in Material context


This panel contains physical properties that control how the object surfaces that use the
material are rendered in real time by the Blender Game Engine.

Physics settings are visible when using the game engine for rendering.
Game physics usage is described :doc:`Here </game_engine/physics/index>`

Friction
   Coulomb friction coefficient when inside the physics distance area.

Elasticity
   Elasticity of collisions.

Force Field
   Controls force field settings.

   Force
      Upward spring force when inside the physics distance area.
   Distance
      Distance of physics area.
   Damping
      Damping of the spring force when inside the physics distance area.
   Align to Normal
      Align dynamic game objects along the surface normal when inside the physics distance area.
