Materials can have a wide array of properties.
It is the combination of all of these things that define the way a material looks,
and how objects using that material will appear when rendered.
These properties are set using the various panels in the material tab.

Remember that the appearance of your materials are affected by the way that they are rendered
(surface, wire, volume or halo), and by the rendering engine (Blender, Cycles, or Game) used.
