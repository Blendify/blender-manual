In many real life situations - like skin or metals -
the color of diffuse and specular reflections can differ slightly,
based on the amount of energy a surface receives or on the light angle of incidence. The
*Ramp Shader* options in Blender allow you to set a range of colors for a
*Material*, and define how the range will vary over a surface,
and how it blends with the 'actual color'
(typically from a material or as output of a texture).

Ramps allow you to precisely control the color gradient across a material,
rather than just a simple blend from a brightened color to a darkened color,
from the most strongly lit area to the darkest lit area.
As well as several options for controlling the gradient from lit to shadowed,
ramps also provide 'normal' input,
to define a gradient from surfaces facing the camera to surfaces facing away from the camera.
This is often used for materials like some types of metallic car paint that change color based
on viewing angle.

Since texture calculations in Blender happen before shading,
the *Ramp Shader* can completely replace texture or material color. But by use of
the mixing options and Alpha values it is possible to create an additional layer of shading in
Blender materials.

   Ramps Panel


The separate *Ramp* panels for the *Diffuse* shader and the
*Specular* shader respectively can be toggled on and off using the

.. figure:: /images/Material-RampsButton.jpg

   button.

By default the Ramp panel opens with two colors; the first stop (*0*)
is black and transparent (Alpha=0) and the second stop (*1*) is white and opaque
(Alpha=1).

The position of the color stop markers can be altered by either
(1) dragging the stop marker in the colorband or (2) by changing the *Pos* value in the

.. figure:: /images/Material-Ramps-StopPos.jpg

   box.

Color and alpha values for each marker can be set by clicking the

.. figure:: /images/Material-Ramps-ColorAlpha.jpg

   box.

Input
   The input menu contains the following options for defining the gradient:

   Shader
      The value as delivered by the material's shader (*Lambert*, *CookTorr*) defines the color.
      Here the amount of light doesn't matter for color, only the direction of the light.
   Energy
      As *Shader*, now also lamp energy, color, and distance are taken into account.
      This makes the material change color when more light shines on it.
   Normal
      The surface normal, relative to the camera, is used for the *Ramp Shader*.
      This is possible with a texture as well, but added for convenience.
   Result
      While all three previous options work per lamp, this option only works after shading calculations.
      This allows full control over the entire shading, including 'Toon' style results.
      Using alpha values here is most useful for tweaking a finishing touch to a material.

Colorbands
==========

   | Panel:    Context *Shading* --> sub-context *Material* --> *Ramps*


A colorband can contain a gradient through a sequence of many colors (with alpha),
each color acting across a certain position in the spectrum.
Colorbands are used in both materials and textures,
as well in other places where a range of colors can be computed and displayed.


Options
^^^^^^^

Add
   Add a new mark to the center of the colorband with the default color (neutral gray).
   New marks can also be added by :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` clicking in the colorband itself,
   which will add the mark at the position of the click with the same color
   that already exists underneath the mouse pointer.
Delete
   Remove the currently selected mark from the colorband.
F
   Flip the colorband.
0
   The number of the active mark.
   The values for this mark are those being displayed,
   and in the colorband, the active mark is displayed as a dashed line.
   Another marker can be selected (1) using the arrows in the

.. figure:: /images/Material-Ramps-MarkerSelectSlider.jpg

 slider, (2) by clicking on the number being displayed and entering a number of a color mark,
 or (3) by :kbd:`LMB` clicking a marker in the colorband.

Pos
   The position of the active color mark in the colorband (range 0.0â€“1.0).
   The position of the color marks can also be changed by :kbd:`LMB` dragging them in the colorband.


.. note:: Reordering colors

   If the position of the color marks are reordered,
   they will be automatically renumbered so that they always start with ``0``
   from the left and increment to the right.


The *Colorswatch* right of the *Position* slider displays the color of the
active mark. :kbd:`LMB` click it to display a color picker in which values for color
(*RGB*) and transparency (*Alpha*) can be set.

Interpolation
   Various modes of interpolation between marker's values can be chosen in the Interpolation menu:

   Ease
      Ease by quadratic equation.
   Cardinal
      Cardinal.
   Linear
      Linear (default). A smooth, consistent transition between colors.
   B-Spline

   Constant
