Shading
*******

Globally de/activates engine features in :menuselection:`Render --> Shading` panel...

Texture
   All :doc:`/render/blender_render/textures/properties/influence/index`
   e.g. color, but also normal and displacement maps.
Shadows
   All :doc:`/render/blender_render/lighting/shadows/index` calculation.
Subsurface Scattering
   All :doc:`/render/blender_render/materials/properties/subsurface_scattering`.
Environment Map
   The :ref:`world texture <bi-world-texture>`.
Ray Tracing
   The :doc:`shadow tracing </render/blender_render/lighting/shadows/raytraced_properties>`.
Alpha
   Switches between a world background to be the sky or transparent.

   Sky, Transparency
World Space Shading
   Shading can optionally be computed in world space rather than camera space. 
   This affects e.g. normal and lamp vectors. This is often more convenient and matches other engines behavior.
