Blender comes equipped with five different lamp types,
each with its own unique strengths and limitations.

   Visual height and shadow markers of two points lamps. Ray Shadow is enabled on the left lamp.

You can add new lamps to a scene using the *Add* menu in the top header, or
with :menuselection:`Add --> Lamp`, :kbd:`Shift-A`.

Once added, a lamp's position is indicated in the 3D View by a solid dot in a circle, but most
types also feature dashed wire-frames that help describe their orientation and properties.
While each type is represented differently,
there are some visual indicators common to all of them:

Shadows
   If shadows are enabled, an additional dashed circle is drawn around the solid circle.
   This makes it easier to quickly determine if a lamp has shadows enabled.
Vertical Height Marker
   This is a dim gray line, which helps locate the lamp's position relative to the global XY plane.
