   Hemi light conceptual scheme.

The *Hemi* lamp provides light from the direction of a 180Â° hemisphere,
designed to simulate the light coming from very wide and far away light source, 
like a heavily clouded or otherwise uniform sky. In other words, it is a light which is
shed, uniformly, by a glowing dome surrounding the scene.

Similar to the *Sun* lamp, the *Hemi* 's location is unimportant,
while its orientation is key.

The *Hemi* lamp is represented with four arcs,
visualizing the orientation of the hemispherical dome,
and a dashed line representing the direction in which the maximum energy is radiated,
the inside of the hemisphere.

   Hemi lamp's panel.

Energy and Color
   These settings are common to most types of lamps, and are described in
   :doc:`Light Properties </render/blender_render/lighting/lights/lamp_panel>`.
Layer, Negative, Specular, and Diffuse
   These settings control what the lamp affects, as described in
   :ref:`What Light Affects <bi-lamp-influence>`.

The *Hemi* lamp has no light falloff settings: it always uses a constant attenuation
(i.e. no attenuation).

Since this lamp is the only lamp which cannot cast any shadow, the *Shadow* panel is absent.
