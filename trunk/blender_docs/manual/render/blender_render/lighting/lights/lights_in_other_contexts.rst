Here are some options closely related to light sources, without being lamps settings.


Lighting Groups
===============

Materials

   Light Group options for Materials


By default, materials are lit by all lamps in all visible layers, but a material
(and thus all objects using that material) can be limited to a single group of lamps.
This sort of control can be incredibly useful, especially in scenes with complex lighting setups.
To enable this, navigate to the *Material* menu's *Options*
panel and select a group of lamps in the *Light Group* field.
Note that a :doc:`light group </modeling/objects/groups_and_parenting>` must be created first.

If the *Exclusive* button is enabled,
lights in the specified group will *only* affect objects with this material.


Render Layers
-------------

   Light Group options for Render Layers


There's a similar control located in the *Layer panel* of the context
:doc:`Render Layers </render/post_process/layers>`.
If a light group name is selected in this *Light* field,
the scene will be lit exclusively by lamps in the specified group.
