  Output Nodes
################

Output nodes are the final node in every node tree.
Although you can add more than one, only one will be used (indicated by a colored or darkened header).
Output nodes are always preceded by :doc:`Shaders </render/shaders/nodes/types/shaders/index>`
except in the case of the :doc:`Displacement </render/materials/components/displacement>` of a Material Output.
