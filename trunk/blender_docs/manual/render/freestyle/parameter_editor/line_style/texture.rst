   Line Style Texture.

Use Nodes/Textures
   Blender Render uses texture mapping and influence panels.
   In Cycles textures are defined by means of
   shader :doc:`nodes </render/freestyle/parameter_editor/line_style/nodes/index>`.
Spacing Along Stroke
   Allows to set the "pace" of textures mapped along the length of strokes.
Go to LineStyle Textures
   The "Go to LineStyle Textures" button is a shortcut to texture settings in the other tab.
