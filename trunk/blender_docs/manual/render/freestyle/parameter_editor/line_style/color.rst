   Line Style Color UI


In this tab you control the color of your strokes.

Base Color
   The base color for this line style.


Modifiers
=========

There are four color modifiers available, which can be mixed with the base color using the usual methods
(see for example the :doc:`Mix compositing node </composite_nodes/types/color/mix>` for further discussion of
this topic). As with other modifier stacks in Blender, they are applied from top to bottom.

Influence
   How much the result of this modifier affects the current color.


Along Stroke
------------

   Line Style Color's Along Stroke modifier


The *Along Stroke* modifier alters the base color with a new one from a given color
ramp mapped along each stroke's length. In other words,
it applies a color ramp along each stroke.

The only settings here are those of the standard Blender color ramp!


Distance from Camera
--------------------

   :width: 300px

   Line Style Color's Distance From Camera modifier


The *Distance from Camera* color modifier alters the base color with a new one from
a given color ramp, using the distance to the active camera as the parameter.

Range Min and Range Max
   The limits of the mapping from "distance to camera" to "color in ramp".
   If the current point of the stroke is at *Range Min* or less from the active camera,
   it will take the start color of the ramp, and conversely,
   if it is at *Range Max* or more from the camera, it will take the end color of the ramp.
   These values are in the current scene's units, not in pixels!

Fill Range by Selection
   Set the min/max range values from the distances between the current selected objects and the camera.

The other settings are those of the standard Blender color ramp!


Distance from Object
--------------------

   :width: 300px

   Line Style Color's Distance From Object modifiers


The *Distance from Object* color modifier alters the base color with a new one from
a given color ramp, using the distance to a given object as the parameter.

Target
   The object to measure distance from.

Range Min and Range Max
   The limits of the mapping from "distance to object" to "color in ramp".
   If the current point of the stroke is at *Range Min* or less from the target,
   it will take the start color of the ramp, and conversely,
   if it is at *Range Max* or more from the target, it will take the end color of the ramp.
   These values are in the current scene's units, not in pixels!

Fill Range by Selection
   Set the min/max range values from the distances between the current selected objects and the target.

The other settings are those of the standard Blender color ramp!


Material
--------

   :width: 300px

   Line Style Color's Material modifiers


The *Material* color modifier alters the base color with a new one taken from the
current material under the stroke.

You can use various properties of the materials, among which many are mono-component (i.e.
give B&W results). In this case,
an optional color ramp can be used to map these grayscale values to colored ones.

If used with the *Split by Material* option in the *Stroke* tab,
the result will not be blurred between materials along the strokes.
