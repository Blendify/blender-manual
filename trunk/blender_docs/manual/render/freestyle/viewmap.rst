Viewmaps
********

There is only one viewmap per render layer. It controls the edge detection parameters.
Which detected edges are actually rendered, and how,
can be controlled either through the user-friendly
:doc:`parameter editor </render/freestyle/parameter_editor/index>`,
or powerful but complex :doc:`Python scripting </render/freestyle/python>`.

Face Smoothness
   When enabled, *Smooth Shading* will be taken into account for edges calculation.
Crease Angle
   If two adjacent faces form an angle less than the defined *Crease Angle*,
   the edge between them will be rendered when using *Crease* edge type selection in a line set.
   The value also affects *Silhouette* edge type selection.
Culling
   Ignore the edges that are out of view (saves some processing time and memory,
   but may reduce the quality of the result in some cases).

*Sphere Radius* It affects the calculation of curvatures for *Ridge*,
*Valley* and *Suggestive Contour* edge type selection in a line set.

Kr Derivative Epsilon
   It provides you with control over the output of *Suggestive Contour* and *Silhouette*
   edge type selection (further information in
   `this pdf <https://wiki.blender.org/index.php/file:Manual-2.6-Render-Freestyle-PrincetownLinestyle.pdf>`__).
