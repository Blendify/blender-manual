   Vector Math Node.

The *Vector Math* node performs the selected math operation on the input vectors.


Inputs
======

The inputs of the node are dynamic. Some inputs are only available in certain operations.
For instance, the *Scale* input is only available in the *Scale* operator.

Vector
   Input vector A.
Vector
   Input vector B.
Scale
   Input Scale.


Properties
==========

Operation
   The vector math operator to be applied on the input vectors.

   Add
      The sum of A and B.

   Subtract
      The difference between A and B.

   Multiply
      The entrywise product of A and B.
      :math:`(A.x * B.x, A.y * B.y, A.z * B.z)`

   Divide
      The entrywise division of A by B. Division by zero returns zero.
      :math:`(A.x / B.x, A.y / B.y, A.z / B.z)`

   Cross Product
      The cross product of A and B.

   Project
      The projection of A onto B.

   Reflect
      The reflection of A around the normal B. B need not be normalized.

   Dot Product
      The dot product of A and B.

   Distance
      The distance between A and B.

   Length
      The length of A.

   Scale
      The result of multiplying A by the scalar input *Scale*.

   Normalize
      The result of normalizing A.

   Snap
      The result of rounding A to the largest integer multiple of B less than or equal A.

   Floor
      The entrywise floor of A.

   Ceil
      The entrywise ceiling of A.

   Modulo
      The entrywise modulo of A by B.

   Fraction
      The fractional part of A.

   Absolute
      The entrywise absolute value of A.

   Minimum
      The entrywise minimum from A and B.

   Maximum
      The entrywise maximum from A and B.


Outputs
=======

The output of the node is dynamic. It is either a vector or a scalar depending on the operator.
For instance, the *Length* operator have a scalar output while the *Add* operator have a vector output.

Vector
   Output vector.
Value
   Output value.
