A *Spot* lamp emits a cone-shaped beam of light from the tip of the cone,
in a given direction.

Lamp Options
============

Distance, Energy and Color
   These settings are common to most types of lamps, and are described in
   :doc:`Light Properties </render/lighting/lamp_panel>`.



Spot Shape

   Changing the Spot options also changes the appearance of the spotlight as displayed in the 3D View.

Size
   The size of the outer cone of a *Spot*,
   which largely controls the circular area a *Spot* light covers.
   This slider in fact controls the angle at the top of the lighting cone,
   and can be between (1.0 to 180.0).

Blend
   The *Blend* slider controls the inner cone of the *Spot*.
   The *Blend* value can be between (0.0 to 1.0).
   The value is proportional and represents that amount of space that the inner cone should
   occupy inside the outer cone *Size*.

   The inner cone boundary line indicates the point at which light from the *Spot* will start to blur/soften;
   before this point its light will mostly be full strength.
   The larger the value of *Blend* the more blurred/soft the edges of the spotlight will be,
   and the smaller the inner cone's circular area will be (as it starts to blur/soften earlier).

   To make the *Spot* have a sharper falloff rate and therefore less blurred/soft edges,
   decrease the value of *Blend*.
   Setting *Blend* to 0.0 results in very sharp spotlight edges, without any transition between light and shadow.

   The falloff rate of the *Spot* lamp light is a ratio between the *Blend* and *Size* values;
   the larger the circular gap between the two, the more gradual the light fades between *Blend* and *Size*.

   *Blend* and *Size* only control the *Spot* light cone's aperture and softness ("radial" falloff);
   they do not control the shadow's softness as shown below.

      Render showing the soft edge spotlighted area and the sharp/hard object shadow.

   Notice in the picture above that the object's shadow is sharp as a result of the ray tracing,
   whereas the spotlight edges are soft.
   If you want other items to cast soft shadows within the *Spot* area, you will need to alter other shadow settings.
