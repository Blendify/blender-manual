Area
****

The *Area* lamp simulates light originating from a surface (or surface-like) emitter.
For example, a TV screen, office neon lamps, a window,
or a cloudy sky are just a few types of area lamp. The area lamp produces shadows with
soft borders by sampling a lamp along a grid the size of which is defined by the user.
This is in direct contrast to point-like artificial lights which produce sharp borders.

   .. tip::

      Choosing the appropriate shape for your *Area* light will enhance the believability of your scene.
      For example, you may have an indoor scene and would like to simulate light entering through a window.
      You could place a *Rectangular* area lamp in a window (vertical) or from neons (horizontal)
      with proper ratio for *Size X* and *Size Y*. For the simulation of the light emitted by
      a TV screen, a vertical *Square* area lamp would be better in most cases.
