Introduction
************

A *Sun* lamp provides light of constant intensity emitted in a single direction from very far away.
A *Sun* lamp can be very handy for a uniform clear daylight open-space illumination.
In the 3D View,
the *Sun* light is represented by an encircled black dot with rays emitting from it,
plus a dashed line indicating the direction of the light.

.. note::

   This direction can be changed by rotating the *Sun* lamp, like any other object,
   but because the light is emitted in a constant direction,
   the location of a *Sun* lamp does not affect the rendered result.
