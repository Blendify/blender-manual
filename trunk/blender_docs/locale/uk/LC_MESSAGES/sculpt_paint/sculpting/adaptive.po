"Dynamic topology (aka dyntopo) is a dynamic tessellation sculpting "

"only affects the shape of a mesh."

"This makes it possible to sculpt complex shapes out of a simple mesh, "

"Dyntopo can be toggled with the checkbox in the header or with "

"When sculpting with multiresolution we have the ability sculpt in "

"Multiresolution Modifier has some limitations. You may end up with some "
"mesh distortions. As an advice, add as more details as possible before "
