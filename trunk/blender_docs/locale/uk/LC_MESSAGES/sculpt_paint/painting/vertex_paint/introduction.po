"When a vertex is painted, the color of the vertex is modified according "
"to the rules of the 'brush'. The color of all visible planes and edges "
"attached to the vertex are then modified with a gradient to the color of "
"the other connected vertices. (Note that the color of non-visible faces "
"is not modified)."

"Vertex colors can be painted by first going into Edit Mode, then "
"switching to *Vertex Paint Mode*; however, it will not show up in the "
"render unless you check *Vertex Color Paint* in the :doc:`Materials "
