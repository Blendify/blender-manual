"Sometimes might want to have more control to blur the image. For "
"instance, you may want to only blur one object while leaving everything "
"else alone (or the other way around), or you want to blur the whole image"
" uniformly all at once. The node, therefore, allows you to use something "
"other than an actual Z-buffer as the Z input. For instance, you could "
"connect an image node and use a grayscale image where the color "
"designates how much to blur the image at that point, where white is the "
"maximum blur and black is no blur. Or, you could use a Time node to "
"uniformly blur the image, where the time value controls the maximum blur "
"for that frame. It may also be used to obtain a possibly slightly better "
"DoF blur, by using a fake depth shaded image instead of a Z-buffer. (A "
"typical method to create the fake depth shaded image is by using a linear"
" blend texture for all objects in the scene or by using the \"fog/mist\" "
"fake depth shading method). This also has the advantage that the fake "
"depth image can have anti-aliasing, which is not possible with a real "
"Z-buffer."

"Keep in mind that this is not real DoF, only a post-processing "

"real world, using shallow depth of field, it is not impossible for nearby"
" objects to become completely invisible, in effect allowing the camera to"
" see behind it. Hollywood cinematographers use this visual characteristic"
" to to achieve the popular \"focus pull\" effect, where the focus shifts "
"from a nearby to a distant object, such that the \"other\" object all but"
