"These nodes give you the essential tools for creating a :term:`Matte` for"
" images that do not already have their own :term:`Alpha Channel`. One "
"usage scenario is blue-screen or green-screen footage, where live action "
"is shot in front of a blue or green backdrop for replacement by a matte "
"painting or virtual background."

"In general, hook up these nodes to a viewer, set your UV/Image Editor to "
"show the viewer node, and play with the sliders in real-time using a "
"sample image from the footage, to get the settings right. In some cases, "
"small adjustments can eliminate artifacts or foreground image "
"degradation. Taking out too much green can result in foreground actors "
"looking flat or blueish/purplish."

"You can and should chain these nodes together, improving your masking and"
" color correction in successive refinements, using each node's strengths "
"to operate on the previous node's output. :doc:`Keying Node "
"</compositing/types/matte/keying>` is the closest to a \"does-it-all\" "
"node for green screens, but the best results stem from a combination of "
"techniques."

msgid ""
"Garbage Matte is not a node, but a technique selecting what to exclude "
"from an image. It is a :term:`Mask` used to identify content to be "
"removed from an image that cannot be removed by an automatic process like"
" chroma keying. It is used either to select specific content to be "
"removed, or it is the inverse of a rough selection of the subject; "
"removing everything else."

"Some nodes accept a garbage matte directly. For those that don't, you can"
" still apply one by subtracting the garbage matte from the matte "
"generated by the node."

"Simple garbage mattes can be created with the :doc:`Box Mask "

"using :doc:`Double Edge Mask </compositing/types/matte/double_edge_mask>`"
