"Tracking Object to generate the gradient. You will probably want to "
"create new a tracking object in the :ref:`Object <movie-clip-tracking-"
"properties-object>` panel, because tracks used for gradients can not "
"actually be used for camera/object tracking. After this tracks might be "
"placed in places where gradient colors should be sampled. These tracks "
"could be tracked or moved manually, so gradients would be updating "
"automatically along the movie. Tracks might have an offset for easier "
"tracking of feature-less screens."
