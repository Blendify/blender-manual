"In the example above, render output from two scenes are mixed using the Z-"
"Offset node, one from a sphere of size 1.30, and the other a cube of size "
"1.00. The sphere and square are located at the same place. The cube is "
"tipped forward, so the corner in the center is closer to the camera than the "
"sphere surface; so Z-Offset chooses to use the cube's pixels. But the sphere "
"is slightly larger (a size of 1.30 versus 1.00), so it does not fit totally "
"inside the cube. At some point, as the cube's sides recede back away from "
"the camera, the sphere's sides are closer. When this happens, Z-offset uses "
"the sphere's pixels to form the resulting picture."

"the illusion of depth as Bambi moved through the forest."
