"Let us animate the *Copy Location* constraint and its *Offset* button. "
"For example, you can make your owner (let us call it \"moon\") describe "
"perfect circles centered on the (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) point (using e.g. "
"pydriven *LocX*/*LocY* animation curves, see :doc:`Drivers "
"</animation/drivers/index>`), and then make it copy the location of a "
"target (called it \"earth\", for example) with the *Offset* button "
"enabled. Congratulation, you just modeled a satellite in a (simplified) "
"orbit around its planet. Just do the same thing with its planet around "
"its star (which you might call \"sun\", what do you think?), and why not,"
" for the star around its galaxy."

" the \"earth\", and finally to nothing, using two *Copy Location* "
"constraints with *Offset* set."
