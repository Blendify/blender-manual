"The *Track To* constraint applies rotations to its owner, so that it "
"always points a given \"To\" axis towards its target, with another \"Up\""
" axis permanently maintained as much aligned with the global Z axis (by "
"default) as possible. This tracking is similar to the \"billboard "
"tracking\" in 3D (see note below)."
