"To understand how changing the space will change the behavior of the "
"constraint, consider experimenting with two empties. Make sure they "
"display as arrows so that you can see the local axes for each empty. Make"
" sure to size one empty a little larger than the other so that they are "
"both always visible even if directly on top of each other. Then add a "
"constraint to one empty that targets the other and experiment thoroughly "
"by moving, rotating and scaling the target in many different ways."
