"The *Shrinkwrap* constraint is the \"object counterpart\" of the "
":doc:`Shrinkwrap Modifier </modeling/modifiers/deform/shrinkwrap>`. It "
"moves the owner origin and therefore the owner object's location to the "
"surface of its target."

msgid ""
"This implies that the target *must* have a surface. In fact, the "
"constraint is even more selective, as it can only use meshes as targets. "
"Hence, the *Shrinkwrap* option is only shown in the *Add Constraint to "
"Active Object* menu, :kbd:`Ctrl-Alt-C`, (or its bone's equivalent), when "
"the selected inactive object is a mesh."
