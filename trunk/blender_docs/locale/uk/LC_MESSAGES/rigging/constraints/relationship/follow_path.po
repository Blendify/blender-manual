"The *Follow Path* constraint places its owner onto a *curve* target "
"object, and makes it move along this curve (or path). It can also affect "
"its owner's rotation to follow the curve's bends, when the *Follow Curve*"
" option is enabled."

"most other vehicles can also use \"invisible\" tracks, the links of a "
"bicycle chain, etc."

"Its location (as shown in the *Transform* panel) is used as an offset "
"from its normal position on the path. E.g. if you have an owner with the "
"(1.0, 1.0, 0.0) location, it will be one BU away from its normal position"
" on the curve, along the X and Y axis. Hence, if you want your owner *on*"
" its target path, clear its location :kbd:`Alt-G`!"

"This location offset is also proportionally affected by the scale of the "
"target curve. Taking the same (1.0, 1.0, 0.0) offset as above, if the "
"curve has a scale of (2.0, 1.0, 1.0), the owner will be offset *two* BU "
"along the X axis (and one along the Y one)..."

"When the *Curve Follow* option is enabled, its rotation is also offset to"
" the one given by the curve (i.e. if you want the Y axis of your object "
"to be aligned with the curve's direction, it must be in rest, non-"
"constrained state, aligned with the global Y axis). Here again, clearing "
"your owner's rotation :kbd:`Alt-R` might be useful..."

msgid ""
"The most simple is to define the number of frames of the movement, in the"
" :ref:`Path Animation panel <curve-path-animation>` of the Curve tab, via"
" the number button Frames, and its start frame via the constraint's "
"Offset option (by default, start frame: 1 [= offset of 0)], duration: "

"*Follow Path* is another constraint that works well with the :doc:`Locked"

"Do not confuse these two constraints. Both of them constraint the "
"location of their owner along a curve, but *Follow Path* is an "
"\"animation-only\" constraint, inasmuch that the position of the owner "
"along the curve is determined by the time (i.e. current frame), whereas "
"the :doc:`Clamp To </rigging/constraints/tracking/clamp_to>` *constraint*"

"location properties' values."
