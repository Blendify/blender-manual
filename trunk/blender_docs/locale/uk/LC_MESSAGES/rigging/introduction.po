"Rigging makes animation possible. Without a good rig animation is incredibly "
"frustrating. Imagine animating a bouncing ball without the ability to squash "
"it against the ground? Try animating a monkey swinging through the trees "
"with no control to make the monkey's hands grab onto the branches. What if "
"you had to animate an army tank speeding through the desert by positioning "
"each tread on the tank one at a time?"

"At its most basic level, rigging solves motion problems. Imagine a door that "
"opens into a hallway. Without a rig, the door will not swing open properly "
"(1). A rig is needed to help the door swing open on its hinges (2, 3, 4), "
"and there are many ways to rig the door. Door 2 gets rigged by repositioning "
"the :term:`Object Origin` of the door. Door 3 gets rigged by :term:"
"`Parenting` the door to an :term:`Empty`. Door 4 gets rigged by :term:"
"`Weight Painting` all of its :term:`Vertices` to a :term:`Bone` in an :term:"
"`Armature`."

"Most production rigs are more complicated than a simple door, but be careful "
"not to rush off building complicated rigs until you have developed some "
"experience. Rigging is a discipline that takes practice. Start by building "
"simple rigs (like a bouncing ball, a tumbling box, an odometer, a clock). "
"Stay humble. Stay patient. Study the fundamental concepts that make a "
"bouncing ball bounce. Add one rigging tool to your toolbox at a time. Test "
"your simple rigs in actual animation projects. And only after much trial and "
"error, consider putting everything together into the sophisticated character "
"rig of your dreams."
