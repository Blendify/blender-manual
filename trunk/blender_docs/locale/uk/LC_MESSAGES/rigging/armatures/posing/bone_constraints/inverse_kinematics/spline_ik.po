"Spline IK is a constraint which aligns a chain of bones along a curve. By"
" leveraging the ease and flexibility of achieving aesthetically pleasing "
"shapes offered by curves and the predictability and well integrated "
"control offered by bones, Spline IK is an invaluable tool in the riggers'"
" toolbox. It is particularly well suited for rigging flexible body parts "
"such as tails, tentacles, and spines, as well as inorganic items such as "
"ropes."

"The Spline IK Constraint is not strictly an 'Inverse Kinematics' method "
"(i.e. IK Constraint), but rather a 'Forward Kinematics' method (i.e. "
"normal bone posing). However, it still shares some characteristics of the"
" IK Constraint, such as operating on multiple bones not being usable for "
"Objects, and being evaluated after all other constraints have been "
"evaluated. It should be noted that if a Standard IK chain and a Spline IK"
" chain both affect a bone at the same time the Standard IK chain takes "
"priority. Such setups are best avoided though, since the results may be "
"difficult to control."

"For optimal deformations, it is recommended that the bones are roughly "
"the same length, and that they are not too long, to facilitate a better "
"fit to the curve. Also, bones should ideally be created in a way that "
"follows the shape of the curve in its 'rest pose' shape, to minimize the "
"problems in areas where the curve has sharp bends which may be especially"
" noticeable when stretching is disabled."

"For control of the curve, it is recommended that hooks (in particular, "
"Bone Hooks) are used to control the control-vertices of the curve, with "
"one hook per control-vertex. In general, only a few control-vertices "
"should be needed for the curve (e.g one for every 3-5 bones offers decent"
" control)."

"The type of curve used does not really matter, as long as a path can be "

"When setting up the rigs, it is currently necessary to have the control "
"bones (for controlling the curve) in a separate armature to those used "
"for deforming the meshes (i.e. the deform rig containing the Spline IK "
"chains). This is to avoid creating pseudo \"Dependency Cycles\", since "
"Blender's Dependency Graph can only resolve the dependencies the control "
"bones, curves, and Spline IK'ed bones on an object by object basis."
