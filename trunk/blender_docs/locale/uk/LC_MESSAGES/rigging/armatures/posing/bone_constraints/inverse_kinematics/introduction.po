"IK allows you to position the last bone in a bone chain and the other "
"bones are positioned automatically. This is like how moving someone's "
"finger would cause his arm to follow it. By normal posing techniques, you"
" would have to start from the root bone, and set bones sequentially till "
"you reach the tip bone: When each parent bone is moved, its child bone "
"would inherit its location and rotation. Thus making tiny precise changes"
" in poses becomes harder farther down the chain, as you may have to "
"adjust all the parent bones first."

"Automatic IK is a tool for quick posing, it can be enabled in the tool "
"shelf in the 3D View, when in pose mode. When the Auto IK option is "
"enabled, translating a bone will activate inverse kinematics and rotate "
"the parent bone, and the parent’s parent, and so on, to follow the "
"selected bone. The IK chain can only extend from a child to a parent bone"
" if the child is *connected* to it."

"The length of the chain is increased (if there is a connected parent "
"available to add to it) with :kbd:`Ctrl-PageUp` or :kbd:`Ctrl-WheelDown`,"
" and decreased with :kbd:`Ctrl-PageDown` or :kbd:`Ctrl-WheelUp`. However,"
" the initial chain length is 0, which effectively means follow the "
"connections to parent bones as far as possible, with no length limit. So "
"pressing :kbd:`Ctrl-PageUp` the first time sets the chain length to 1 "
"(move only the selected bone), and pressing :kbd:`Ctrl-PageDown` at this "
"point sets it back to 0 (unlimited) again. Thus, you have to press :kbd"
":`Ctrl-PageUp` *more than once* from the initial state to set a finite "
"chain length greater than 1."
