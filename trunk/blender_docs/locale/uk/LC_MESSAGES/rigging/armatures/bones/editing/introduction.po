"These are standard editing methods, quite similar for example to :doc:"
"`meshes </modeling/meshes/editing/introduction>` editing. Blender also "
"features a more advanced \"armature sketching\" tool, called :doc:`Etch-a-"
"Ton </rigging/armatures/bones/editing/sketching>`. The same tool might also "

"One important thing to understand about armature editing is that you edit "
"the *rest position* of your armature, i.e. its \"default state\". An "
"armature in its *rest position* has all bones with *no* rotation and scaled "
"to 1.0 in their own local space."

"The different :doc:`poses </rigging/armatures/posing/index>` you might "
"create afterwards are based on this rest position. So if you modify it in "
"*Edit Mode*, all the poses already existing will also be modified. Thus you "
"should in general be sure that your armature is definitive before starting "
"to :doc:`skin </rigging/armatures/skinning/index>` and :doc:`pose </rigging/"
"armatures/posing/index>` it!"
