"Are Bones which act in a similar way to switches, in that, they control how "
"other bones or objects react when they are transformed. A Control Bone could "
"for example act as a sliding switch control when the bone is in one position "
"to the left it could indicate to other bones that they react in a particular "
"way when transformed, when the Control Bone is positioned to the right, "
"transforming other bones or objects could do something completely different. "
"Control Bones are not directly used to alter the positions of vertices, in "
"fact, Control Bones often have no vertices directly associated with "
"themselves."
