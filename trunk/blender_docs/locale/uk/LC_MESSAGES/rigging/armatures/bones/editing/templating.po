msgid ""
"This conversion method can use as reference bones either the selected "

"armature. In general, it is a better idea to create new \"templated\" "
"bones inside the \"reference\" armature, so you can precisely select "
"which bones to use as template -- if you want the new bones in a "
"different armature, you can then use the *Separate* :kbd:`Ctrl-Alt-P` and"

"This tool only considers *one* chain of bones, so it is better to select "

"chain armature object as template). Else, the chain of the template "

"strokes, and the other chains will just be \"copied\" *as is*, without "
"any modification."

"If you have strokes only made of straight segments, they must have *at "

"the newly created chain is not mapped at all to the stroke, and remains "
