"Bendy Bones (B-Bones) are an easy way to replace long chains of many "
"small rigid bones. A common use case for curve bones is to model spine "
"columns or facial bones."

"Blender treats the bone as a section of a Bézier curve passing through "
"the bones' joints. Each *Segments* will bend and roll the  to follow this"
" invisible curve representing a tessellated point of the Bézier curve. "
"The control points at each end of the curve are the endpoints of the "
"bone. The shape of the B-Bones can be controlled using a series of "
"properties or indirectly through the neighboring bones (i.e. first child "
"and parent). The properties construct handles on either end of the bone "
"to control the curvature."
