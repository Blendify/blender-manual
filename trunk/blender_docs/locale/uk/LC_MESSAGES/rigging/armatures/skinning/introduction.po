"We have seen in :doc:`previous pages </rigging/armatures/index>` how to "
"design an armature, create chains of bones, etc. Now, having a good rig "
"is not the final goal, unless you want to produce a \"Dance Macabre\" "
"animation, you will likely want to put some flesh on your skeletons! "
"Surprisingly, \"linking\" an armature to the object(s) it should "
"transform and/or deform is called the \"skinning\" process..."
