"To add an effect strip, select one base strip (image, movie, or scene) by"
" :kbd:`RMB` clicking on it. For some effects, like the Cross transition "
"effect, you will need to :kbd:`Shift-RMB` a second overlapping strip (it "
"depends on the effect you want). Then select :menuselection:`Add --> "
"Effect` and pick the effect you want from the pop-up menu. When you do, "
"the Effect strip will be shown above the source strips. If it is an "
"independent effect, like the :doc:`Color Generator "
"</editors/vse/sequencer/strips/effects/color>`, it will be placed at the "
"position of the frame indicator."

"Since most Effects strips depend on one or two source strips, their frame"
