"The Add Effect adds the colors of two strips together, Use this effect "
"with a base image strip, and a modifier strip. The modifier strip is "
"either a solid color or a black-and-white mask, or another image "
"entirely."

"You can use this effect to increase the brightness of an image, or if you"
" use a BW mask, selectively increase the brightness of certain areas of "
"the image. The Mix node, in Add mode, does exactly the same thing as the "
"Add SFX strip here, and is controlled the same way by feeding the Factor "
"input."

"The example to the right shows what happens when you add gray to an "
"image, and animate the effect over time. The image gets bright because we"
" are adding gray (R:.5, G:.5, B:.5) to say, a blue color (R.1, G:.1, "
"B:.5) resulting in (R:.6, G:.6, B:1.0) which retains the original hue "
"(relationship between the colors) but is much brighter (has a higher "
"value). When applied to the whole image like this, the whole image seems "
"to flash."
