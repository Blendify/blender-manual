"An audio track (strip) is just like any other strip in the VSE. You can "

"To animate audio strips simply hit :kbd:`I` over any of its values. "
"Examples of animating an audio strip are to fade in/out background music "
"or to adjust volume levels. Layered/crossed audio strips are added "
"together; the lower channel does not override and cut out higher channels"
" (unlike image and video strips). This makes Blender an audio mixer. By "
"adding audio tracks and using the curves to adjust each tracks' sound "
"level, you have an automated dynamic multi-track audio mixer!"
