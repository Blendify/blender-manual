"Using the alpha (transparency channel), this effect composites a result "
"based on transparent areas of the dominant image. If you use a Scene "
"strip, the areas of the image where there is not anything solid are "
"transparent; they have an alpha value of 0. If you use a movie strip, "
"that movie has an alpha value of 1 (completely opaque)."

"So, you can use the *Alpha Over* / *Alpha Under* effect to composite the "
"CGI Scene on top of your movie. The result is your model doing whatever "

"Opacity` controls how much the foreground is mixed over the background, "
