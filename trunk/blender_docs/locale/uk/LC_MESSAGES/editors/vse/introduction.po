"In addition to modeling and animation, Blender can be used to edit video. "
"There are two possible methods for this one being the :doc:`Compositor </"
"compositing/introduction>`. However, this chapter is on the other, the Video "
"Sequence Editor (VSE) and some time shorten to just Sequencer. The Sequencer "
"within Blender is a complete video editing system that allows you to combine "
"multiple video channels and add effects to them. You can use these effects "
"to create powerful video edits (especially when you combine it with the "
"animation power of Blender!)."

"To use the VSE, you load multiple video clips and lay them end-to-end (or in "
"some cases, overlay them), inserting fades and transitions to link the end "
"of one clip to the beginning of another. Finally, you can audio and "
"synchronize the timing of the video sequence to match it."

"The View Types toggles in the header allow you to change the view of the "
"VSE. When the first button is toggled only the sequencer is displayed (the "
"default). The second button displays only the Preview region, and the third "
"button displays both the Sequencer and the Preview."
