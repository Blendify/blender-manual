"A proxy is a smaller image (faster to load) that stands in for the main "
"image. When you rebuild proxies Blender computes small images (like "
"thumbnails) for the big images and may take some time. After computing "
"them, though, editing functions like scrubbing and scrolling is much "
"faster but gives a low-res result. Make sure to disable proxies before "
"final rendering."
