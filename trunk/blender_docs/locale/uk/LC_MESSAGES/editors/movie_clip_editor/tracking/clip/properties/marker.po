"Makes sense after solving the movie clip, and it works in the following "
"way: the solved position of each track gets projected back to the movie "
"clip and displayed as a small point. The color of the point depends on "
"the distance between the projected coordinate and the original "
"coordinate: if they are close enough, the point is green, otherwise it "
"will be red. This helps to find tracks which were not solved nicely and "
"need to be tweaked."

"The way in which markers are displayed compact (black outline and yellow "
"foreground color) makes tracks visible on all kind of footage (both dark "
"and light). But sometimes it can be annoying and this option will make "
"the marker display more compactly -- the outline is replaced by dashed "
"black lines drawn on top of the foreground, so that marker areas are only"
" 1px thick."
