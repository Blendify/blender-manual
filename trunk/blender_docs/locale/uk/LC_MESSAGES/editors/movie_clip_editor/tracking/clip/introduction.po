#~ " which algorithm is used, different "
#~ "settings are displayed, but there are"
#~ " a few that are common for all"
#~ " tracker settings:"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "*Adjust Frames* controls which patterns "
#~ "get tracked; to be more precise, "
#~ "the pattern from which frame is "
#~ "getting tracked. Here is an example "
#~ "which should make things clearer."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "The tracker algorithm receives two "
#~ "images inside the search area and "
#~ "the position of a point to be "
#~ "tracked in the first image. The "
#~ "tracker tries to find the position "
#~ "of that point from the first image"
#~ " in the second image."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Now, this is how tracking of the"
#~ " sequence happens. The second image "
#~ "is always from a frame at which"
#~ " the position of marker is not "
#~ "known (next tracking frame). But a "
#~ "different first image (instead of the"
#~ " one that immediately precedes the "
#~ "second image in the footage) can "
#~ "be sent to the tracker. Most "
#~ "commonly used combinations:"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "An image created from a frame on"
#~ " which the track was keyframed. This"
#~ " configuration prevents sliding from the"
#~ " original position (because the position"
#~ " which best corresponds to the "
#~ "original pattern is returned by the "
#~ "tracker), but it can lead to small"
#~ " jumps and can lead to failures "
#~ "when the feature point is deformed "
#~ "due to camera motion (perspective "
#~ "transformation, for example). Such a "
#~ "configuration is used if *Adjust Frames*"
#~ " is set to 0."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "An image created from the current "
#~ "frame is sent as first image to"
#~ " the tracker. In this configuration "
#~ "the pattern is tracking between two "
#~ "neighboring frames. It allows dealing "
#~ "with cases of large transformations of"
#~ " the feature point but can lead "
#~ "to sliding from the original position,"
#~ " so it should be controlled. Such "
#~ "a configuration is used if *Adjust "
#~ "Frames* is set to 1."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "If *Adjust Frames* is greater than "
#~ "1, the behavior of tracker is: "
#~ "keyframes for tracks are creating every"
#~ " *Adjust Frames* frames, and tracking "
#~ "between keyframed image and next image"
#~ " is used."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Speed"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "can be used to control the speed"
#~ " of sequence tracking. This option "
#~ "does not affect the quality of "
#~ "tracking; it just helps to control "
#~ "if tracking happens accurately. In most"
#~ " cases tracking happens much faster "
#~ "than real time, and it is "
#~ "difficult to notice when a track "
#~ "began to slide out of position. In"
#~ " such cases *Speed* can be set "
#~ "to Double or Half to add some "
#~ "delay between tracking two frames, so"
#~ " slide-off would be noticed earlier"
#~ " and the tracking process can be "
#~ "canceled to adjust positions of tracks."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Frames Limit"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "controls how many frames can be "
#~ "tracked when the Track Sequence operator"

#~ msgid "KLT Tracker Options"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "The KLT tracker is the algorithm "
#~ "used by default. It allows tracking "
#~ "most kinds of feature points and "
#~ "their motion. It uses pyramid tracking"
#~ " which works in the following way."
#~ " The algorithm tracks an image larger"
#~ " than the defined pattern first to"
#~ " find the general direction of "
#~ "motion. Then it tracks a slightly "
#~ "smaller image to refine the position "
#~ "from the first step and make the"
#~ " final position more accurate. This "
#~ "iterates several times. The number of"
#~ " steps of such tracking is equal "
#~ "to the *Pyramid Level* option and "
#~ "we tell that on first step "
#~ "tracking happens for highest pyramid "
#~ "level. So Pyramid Level=1 is equal "
#~ "to pattern itself, and each next "
#~ "level doubles tracking image by 2."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "The search area should be larger "
#~ "than the highest pyramid level and "
#~ "the \"free space\" between the search"
#~ " area and highest pyramid level "
#~ "defines how much the feature can "
#~ "move from one frame to another and"
#~ " still be tracked."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Default settings should work in most "
#~ "general cases, but sometimes the pyramid"
#~ " level should be changed. For "
#~ "example, when footage is blurry, adding"
#~ " extra pyramid levels helps to track"
#~ " them."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "This algorithm can fail in situations"
#~ " where a feature point is moving "
#~ "in one direction and the texture "
#~ "around that feature point is moving "
#~ "in another direction."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "SAD tracker options"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "On each step, the SAD tracker "
#~ "reviews the whole search area and "
#~ "finds the pattern on the second "
#~ "image which is most like the "
#~ "pattern which is getting tracking. This"
#~ " works pretty quickly, but can fail"
#~ " in several cases. For example, when"
#~ " there is another feature point which"
#~ " looks like the tracking feature "
#~ "point in the search area. In this"
#~ " case, SAD will tend to jump "
#~ "off track from one feature to "
#~ "another."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "*Correlation* defines the threshold value "
#~ "for correlation between two patterns "
#~ "which is still considered successful "
#~ "tracking. 0 means there is no "
#~ "correlation at all, 1 means correlation"
#~ " is full."
