"This is only a visual feedback, which doesn't mean that the camera motion"
" will not reconstruct with less than eight tracks. It only means that you"
" should pay attention to those frames and check if all possible good "
"feature points are tracked there. Remember, if there are no good feature "
"points in the frame and there are less than 16 tracks in the frame, it "
"doesn't mean the solution won't be accurate. Rather, adding more tracks "
"on bad feature points will reduce the accuracy of solution."
