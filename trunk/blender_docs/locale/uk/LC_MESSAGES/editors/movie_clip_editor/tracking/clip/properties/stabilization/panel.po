"There is one extra panel which is available in reconstruction mode -- 2D "
"Stabilization Panel. The purpose of this feature is to smooth out jerky "
"camera handling on existing real world footage. To activate the 2D "
"stabilizer, you need to set the toggle in the panel, and additionally you"
" need to enable *Display Stabilization* in the Display panel. Then you'll"
" need to set up some tracking points to detect the image movements."

"The 2D Stabilization panel is used to define the data used for 2D "
"stabilization of the shot. Several options are available in this panel: "
"you may add a list of tracks to determine lateral image shifts and "
"another list of tracks to determine tilting and zooming movements. Based "
"on the average contribution of these tracks, a compensating movement is "
"calculated and applied to each frame."
