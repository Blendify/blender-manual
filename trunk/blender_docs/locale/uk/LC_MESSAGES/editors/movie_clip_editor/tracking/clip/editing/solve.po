"The *Create Plane Track* operator creates a new plane track. Planar "
"tracking takes advantage of the fact that there are often planar surfaces"
" in footage, by attaching markers to points on these flat planes. It can "
"be used to replace things like billboards and screens on the footage with"
" another image or video. It also might be used for masking."

"This button will create a plane object which is deforming in the same way"

"Feature points used to estimate plane motion could be used from any place"

"Tripod Motion can be used for footage where the camera does not move and "
"only rotates. Such footage can't be tracked with a generic solver "
"approach, and it is impossible to determine the actual feature points in "
"space due to a lack of information. So this solver will solve only the "
"relative camera rotation and then reproject the feature points into a "
"sphere, with the same distance between feature and camera for all feature"
" points."
