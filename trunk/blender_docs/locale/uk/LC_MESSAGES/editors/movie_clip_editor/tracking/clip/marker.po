"The whole marker can be moved with :kbd:`RMB` or by dragging the anchor "
"point (black dot) with :kbd:`LMB`. Pressing :kbd:`G` also translates the "
"whole marker. When pressing  :kbd:`G` twice the marker will be translated"
" while keeping the anchor in place. Note that the anchor point outside "
"the pattern area is shown as a cross connected with marker position with "
"a dashed line."

":kbd:`S` scales the whole marker. The whole pattern area only will be "
"scaled by pressing :kbd:`S` twice; The Pattern can also be rotated using "
"the :kbd:`R` button which, depending on the used pivot point, will either"
" rotate patterns around their own centers or rotate the whole markers "
"around e.g. the median point."

"To match the perspective transformation of a marker on a plane, the "
"individual corners must be edited manually. Each marker corner can deform"
" individually to define the shapes. Corner positions can be edited by "
"dragging them with a mouse. Dragging with :kbd:`LMB` will change the "
"position of an individual corner."

"Note that deforming a pattern is not only useful for planar / affine "
"tracking. Since only pixels within the pattern will be considered this "
"can help to specify a better pattern to track even for simple position "
"tracking."
