"the node group you can click into to change the name of the group. Change"
" the name of the node group to something meaningful. When appending node "
"groups from one blend file to another, Blender does not make a "
"distinction between material node groups or composite node groups, so it "
"is recommended some naming convention, that will allow you to easily "
"distinguish between the two types."
