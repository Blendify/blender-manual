"3D scenes often become exponentially more confusing as they grow more "

"Armatures can also become very complex, with different types of bones, "
"controllers, solvers, custom shapes, and so on. Since armatures are "
"usually located close together, this can quickly become cluttered. "

"armature (rig) across layers and only display those layers you wish to "
