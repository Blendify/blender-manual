"Mirroring an Object or Mesh selection will create a reversed version of "

"To mirror a selection along a particular global axis press: "

"In Mesh mode, you can mirror the selection on the currently selected "

"pressing the appropriate axis key a second time. For example, if the "
"Transform Orientation is set to *Normal*, pressing: :kbd:`Ctrl-M`, "
"followed by :kbd:`X` and then :kbd:`X` again will mirror the selection "
"along the X-axis of the *Normal Orientation*."
