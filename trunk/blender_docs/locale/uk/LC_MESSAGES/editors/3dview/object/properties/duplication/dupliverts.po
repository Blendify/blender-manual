"*Duplication Vertices* or *DupliVerts* is the duplication of a base "
"object at the location of the vertices of a mesh. In other words, when "
"using *DupliVerts* on a mesh, an instance of the base object is placed on"
" every vertex of the mesh."

"There are actually two approaches to modeling using *DupliVerts*. They "
"can be used as an arranging tool, allowing to model geometrical "
"arrangements of objects (e.g. the columns of a Greek temple, the trees in"
" a garden, an army of robot soldiers, the desks in a classroom). The "
"object can be of any object type which Blender supports. The second "
"approach is to use them to model an object starting from a single part of"
" it (e.g. the spikes in a club, the thorns of a sea-urchin, the tiles in "
"a wall, the petals in a flower)."
