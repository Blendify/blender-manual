"However, there are cases in which you really prefer to just navigate your"

" has limitations, for example after zooming a lot of panning is extremely"
" uncomfortable and difficult, or you apparently cannot move the camera "
"any nearer. As an example, try to navigate to a very distant object in "
"the view with traditional methods (explained above) and see what you can "
