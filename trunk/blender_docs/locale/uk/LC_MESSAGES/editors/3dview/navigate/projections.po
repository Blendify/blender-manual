"Our eye is used to perspective viewing because distant objects appear "
"smaller. Orthographic projection often seems a bit odd at first, because "
"objects stay the same size regardless of their distance. It is like viewing "
"the scene from an infinitely distant point. Nevertheless, orthographic "
"viewing is very useful (it is the default in Blender and most other 3D "
"applications), because it provides a more \"technical\" insight into the "
"scene, making it easier to draw and judge proportions."

"To change the projection for a 3D View, choose the :menuselection:`View --> "
"Orthographic` or the :menuselection:`View --> Perspective` menu entry. The :"
"kbd:`Numpad5` shortcut toggles between the two modes. Changing the "
"projection for a 3D View does not affect the way the scene will be rendered. "
"Rendering is in perspective by default. If you need to create an "
"orthographic rendering, select the camera, go to the Camera tab and press "
"the *Orthographic* button in the *Lens* panel."
