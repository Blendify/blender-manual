"Blender has the ability to encapsulate (incorporate) various kinds of data "
"within the blend-file that is normally saved outside of the blend-file. For "
"example, an image texture that is an external image file can be put \"inside"
"\" the blend-file via :menuselection:`File --> External Data --> Pack into "
"blend-file`. When the blend-file is saved, a copy of that image file is put "
"inside the blend-file. The blend-file can then be copied or emailed "
"anywhere, and the image texture moves with it."
