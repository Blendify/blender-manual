"Many blend-files reference external images or other linked blend-files. A "
"path tells Blender where to look for these files. If the external files are "
"moved, the blend-file that references them will not look right."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/data_system/files/relative_paths.rst:10
msgid ""
"When you specify one of these external files, the default option is to make "
"the path relative. Blender stores a partial path evaluated relative to the "
"directory location of the referencing blend-file. This choice helps when you "
"need to reorganize folders or move your files."

msgid ""
"With a relative path, you can move the blend-file to a new location provided "
"the externally linked files are moved along with it. For example, you could "
"send someone a folder that contains a blend-file and a sub-folder of "
"external images that it references."

"When relative paths are supported, the File Browser provides a *Relative "
"Path* check box, when entering the path into a text field, use a double "
"slash prefix (``//``) to make it so."

"You cannot enter relative paths into a new *untitled* blend-file. Save it "
"before linking to external files."

"If it is necessary to relocate a blend-file relative to its linked "
"resources, use Blender's File :doc:`Save As </data_system/files/save>` "
"function which has an option to *Remap Relative* file links."
