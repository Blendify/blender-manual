msgid ""
"There is a `well-known limitation <https://developer.blender.org/T40301>`__ "
"with drivers on bones that refer to another bone in the same armature. Their "
"values can be incorrectly calculated based on the position of the other bone "
"as it was *before* you adjust the current_frame. This can lead to obvious "
"shape glitches when the rendering of frames has a jump in the frame number "
"(either because the blend-file is currently on a different frame number or "
"because you are skipping already rendered frames)."
