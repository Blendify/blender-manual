"The purpose of a Keyframe is to allow for interpolated animation, meaning, "
"for example, that the user could then add another key on frame 10, "
"specifying the cube's horizontal position at 20m, and Blender will "
"automatically determine the correct position of the cube for all the frames "
"between frame 1 and 10 depending on the chosen interpolation method (e.g. "
"Linear, Bézier, Quadratic, etc)."
