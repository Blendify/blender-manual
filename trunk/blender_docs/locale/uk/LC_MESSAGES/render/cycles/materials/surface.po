"A major difference from non-physically based renderers is that direct "
"light reflection from lamps and indirect light reflection of other "
"surfaces are not decoupled, but rather handled using a single :abbr:`BSDF"
" (Bidirectional scattering distribution function)`. This limits the "
"possibilities a bit, but we believe overall it is helpful in creating "
"consistent-looking renders with fewer parameters to tune."

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/materials/surface.rst:42
msgid ""
"For the glossy :abbr:`BSDF (Bidirectional scattering distribution "
"function)` s, the *roughness* parameter controls the sharpness of the "
"reflection, from 0.0 (perfectly sharp) to 1.0 (very soft). Compared to "
"*hardness* or *exponent* parameters, it has the advantage of being in the"
" range 0.0..1.0, and as a result gives more linear control and is more "
"easily textureable. The relation is roughly: *roughness* = 1 - "
"1/*hardness*"

"Currently Blender is coded to use an unsquared model. So if you are using"
" a :term:`Roughness Map` chances are that the result will not be "
"accurate. To fix this, you can square the texture by connecting the "
"texture to a :doc:`Math node </render/cycles/nodes/types/converter/math>`"
" and either setting it to *Multiply* and inputing the texture in both "
"input sockets, or use the *Power* function and setting the second input "
"to 2."
