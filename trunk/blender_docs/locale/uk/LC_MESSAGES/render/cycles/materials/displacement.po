"The shape of the surface and the volume inside its mesh may be altered by"
" the displacement shaders. This way, textures can then be used to make "

"There are two types of displacement methods that can be used: `True "
"Displacement`_  and `Bump Mapping`_. Depending on the settings, the "
"displacement may be virtual, only modifying the surface normals to give "
"the impression of displacement, known as bump mapping, or a combination "
"of real and virtual displacement."

"When using the *Bump* method for displacement a \"bump map\" is used to "
"create fake displacement by using light and shadow effects. A bump map is"
" actually one of the older types displacement methods (see `True "
"Displacement`_ for a newer method)."

"Typically, bump maps are grayscale images with 8-bits of color "
"information. This means that they only have 256 different shades of "
"black, gray, or white. These grayscale values are used to tell Blender "
"two thing: up or down."

"When values in a bump map are close to 50% gray, there is little to no "
"detail that comes through on the surface. When values get closer to "
"white, the effect start to appear as if they are pulling out the surface."
" To contrast that, when values closer to black, they appear to be pushing"
" into the surface."

"Bump maps are really great for creating tiny details on a model, for "
"example, pores or wrinkles on skin. Bump maps can be created in a 2D "
"drawing, or photo editing application just remember to save the image as "
"a grayscale to save memory while rendering."

"Because bump mapping is a fake effect, it is easily broken when viewing a"

"Different from bump mapping, *True Displacement* is not a fake effect. "
"When using *True Displacement* the actual mesh geometry will be displaced"
" before render. This gives the best quality results, if the mesh is "
"finely subdivided. As a result this method is also the most memory "
"intensive."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When using true displacement you should not just use a bump map as the "
"displacement texture. Different from bump maps displacement maps should "
"not use 8-bits when saved. While you can use 8-bit textures, they do not "
"translate into 3D space well. Instead, you should save the images with "
"either 16 or 32-bits."

"In the example above a math node is used twice, the first math node uses "
"the add operator. This operation can be used to control the mid-level of "
"the displacement. The second math node uses the multiply operation to "
"control how strong the displacement effect is. Higher values would give "
"you larger displacement and lower values give smaller displacement."
