"Volume rendering can be used to render effects like fire, smoke, mist, "
"absorption in glass, and many other effects that cannot be represented by"
" surface meshes alone."

msgid ""
"To set up a volume, you create a mesh that defines the bounds within "
"which the volume exists. In the material you typically remove the surface"
" nodes and instead connect volume nodes to define the shading inside the "
"volume. For effects such as absorption in glass you can use both a "
"surface and volume shader. The world can also use a volume shader to "
"create effects such as mist."

"Volume Absorption will absorb part of the light as it passes through the "
"volume. This can be used to shade for example black smoke or colored "
"glass objects, or mixed with the volume scatter node. This node is "
"somewhat similar to the transparent BSDF node, it blocks part of the "
"light and lets other light pass straight through."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/materials/volume.rst:26
msgid ""
"Volume Scatter lets light scatter in other directions as it hits "
"particles in the volume. The anisotropy defines in which direction the "
"light is more likely to scatter. A value of 0 will let light scatter "
"evenly in all directions (somewhat similar to the diffuse BSDF node), "
"negative values let light scatter mostly backwards, and positive values "
"let light scatter mostly forward. This can be used to shade white smoke "
"or clouds for example."

"All volume shaders have a density input. The density defines how much of "
"the light will interact with the volume, getting absorbed or scattered, "
"and how much will pass straight through. For effects such as smoke you "
"would specify a density field to indicate where in the volume there is "
"smoke and how much (density bigger than 0), and where there is no smoke "
"(density equals 0)."

msgid ""
"Volumes in real life consist of particles, a higher density means there "
"are more particles per unit volume. More particles means there is a "
"higher chance for light to collide with a particle and get absorbed or "

"A material may have both a surface and a volume shader, or only one of "
"either. Using both may be useful for materials such as glass, water or "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When the surface shader does not reflect or absorb light, it enters into "
"the volume. If no volume shader is specified, it will pass straight "
"through to the other side of the mesh. If it is defined, a volume shader "
"describes the light interaction as it passes through the volume of the "
"mesh. Light may be scattered, absorbed, or emitted at any point in the "
"volume."

"Normals must point outside for correct results. The normals are used to "

"Currently, this is most useful for night time or other dark scenes, as "
"the world surface shader or sun lamps will have no effect if a volume "
"shader is used. This is because the world background is assumed to be "
"infinitely far away, which is accurate enough for the sun for example. "
"However, for modeling effects such as fog or atmospheric scattering, it "
"is not a good assumption that the volume fills the entire space, as most "
"of the distance between the sun and the earth is empty space. For such "
"effects it is be better to create a volume object surrounding the scene. "
"The size of this object will determine how much light is scattered or "
"absorbed."

"Real world effects such as scattering in clouds or subsurface scattering "

"effects is slow and noisy. In typical movie production scenes only 0 or 1"
" bounces might be used to keep render times under control. The effect you"
