"When the surface shader does not reflect or absorb light, it enters into the "

"If it is defined, a volume shader describes the light interaction as it "
"passes through the volume of the mesh. Light may be scattered, absorbed, or "
"emitted at any point in the volume."

"A material may have both a surface and a volume shader, or only one of "
"either. Using both may be useful for materials such as glass, water or ice, "
"where you want some of the light to be absorbed as it passes through the "
"surface, combined with e.g. a glass or glossy shader at the surface."

msgid ""
"The material system is built with physics-based rendering in mind, cleanly "
"separating how a material looks and which rendering algorithm is used to "
"render it. This makes it easier to achieve realistic results and balanced "
"lighting, though there are a few things to keep in mind."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In order for materials to work well with global illumination, they should "
"be, speaking in terms of physics, energy conserving. That means they cannot "
"reflect more light than comes in. This property is not strictly enforced, "
"but if colors are in the range 0.0 to 1.0, and :abbr:`BSDF (Bidirectional "
"scattering distribution function)` s are only mixed together with the Mix "
"Shader node, this will automatically be true."

msgid ""
"It is however, possible to break this, with color values higher than 1.0 or "
"using the Add Shader node, but one must be careful when doing this to keep "
"materials behaving predictably under various lighting conditions. It can "
"result in a reflection adding light into the system at each bounce, turning "
"a :abbr:`BSDF (Bidirectional scattering distribution function)` into a kind "
"of emitter."
