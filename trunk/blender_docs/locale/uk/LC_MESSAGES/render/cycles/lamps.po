msgid ""
"Next to lighting from the background and any object with an emission "
"shader, lamps are another way to add light into the scene. The difference"
" is that they are not directly visible in the rendered image, and can be "
"more easily managed as objects of their own type."

"Spot lamps emit light in a particular direction, inside a cone. By "

"Area lamps can also function as light portals to help sample the "

"In outdoor scenes most rays do not bounce much and just fly off into the "

msgid ""
"Because they are not located inside the scene, their strength uses "
