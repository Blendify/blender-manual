"The *Fresnel* or *Dielectric Fresnel* node computes how much light is "
"reflected off a layer, where the rest will be refracted through the "
"layer. The resulting weight can be used for layering shaders with the "
"*Mix Shader* node. It is dependent on the angle between the surface "
"normal and the viewing direction."

"The most common use is to mix between two BSDFs using it as a blending "
"factor in a mix shader node. For a simple glass material you would mix "
"between a glossy refraction and glossy reflection. At grazing angles more"
" light will be reflected than refracted as happens in reality."

"For a two-layered material with a diffuse base and a glossy coating, you "
"can use the same setup, mixing between a diffuse and glossy BSDF. By "
"using the Fresnel as the blending factor you are specifying that any "
"light which is refracted through the glossy coating layer would hit the "
"diffuse base and be reflected off that."
