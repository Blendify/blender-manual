"Conceptually, grouping nodes allows you to specify a *set* of nodes that "
"you can treat as though it were \"just one node\". Node groups are "
"similar to functions in programming. You can then reuse it inside, which "
"are then called \"NodeGroups\", or in other blend-file(s), when appending"
" called \"NodeTrees\"."

"As an example:  If you have created a material that you would like to use"
" with different inputs e.g. diffuse color: red plastic, green plastic. "
"You could create different materials with *Make Single User* for each "
"different color with a copy of the tree part describing the plastic "
"material. If you like to edit the material you would need to redo the "
"edit on all materials. A better method of reuse is to create node groups,"
" exposing only the variable inputs (e.g. diffuse color)."

" A node group will have a green title bar. All of the selected nodes will"
" now be contained within the group node. Default naming for the node "
"group is \"NodeGroup\", \"NodeGroup.001\" etc. There is a name field in "
"the node group you can click into to change the name of the group. Change"
" the name of the node group to something meaningful. When appending node "
"groups from one blend file to another, Blender does not make a "
"distinction between material node groups or composite node groups, so it "
"is recommended some naming convention, that will allow you to easily "
"distinguish between the two types."
