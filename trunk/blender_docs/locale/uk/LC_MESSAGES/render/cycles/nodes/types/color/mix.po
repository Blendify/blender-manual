"In the top RGB curve, *Darken*, only the right side of the curve was "

"less Y output. The *Enhance Contrast* RGB (S shaped) curve scales the "
"output such that middle values of X change dramatically; namely, the "
"middle brightness scale is expanded, and thus, whiter whites and blacker "
"blacks are output. To make this curve, simply click on the curve and a "
"new control point is added. Drag the point around to bend the curve as "
"you wish. The Mix node combines these two effects equally, and Suzanne "
"feels much better."

"In the old days, a pattern was pressed into the paper mush as it dried, "

"Probably the first form of subliminal advertising. Nowadays, people "
"watermark their images to identify them as personal intellectual "
"property, for subliminal advertising of the author or hosting service, or"
" simply to track their image's proliferation throughout the web. Blender "

"First, construct your own personal watermark. You can use your name, a "
"word, or a shape or image not easily replicated. While neutral gray works"
" best using the encoding method suggested, you are free to use other "
"colors or patterns. It can be a single pixel or a whole gradient; it is "
"up to you. In the example below, we are encoding the watermark in a "
"specific location in the image using the *Translate* node; this helps "
"later because we only have to look at a specific location for the mark. "
"We then use the RGB to BW node to convert the image to numbers that the "
"Map Value node can use to make the image subliminal. In this case, it "
"reduces the mark to one-tenth of its original intensity. The Add node "
"adds the corresponding pixels, make the ones containing the mark ever-so-"
"slightly brighter."

"Various image compression algorithms lose some of the original; the "

"Blender's image format settings, reloading the watermarked image after "
"saving, to get an acceptable result. In the example above, the mark was "
