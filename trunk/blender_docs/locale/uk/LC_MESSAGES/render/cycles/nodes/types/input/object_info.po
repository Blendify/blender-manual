"The *Object Info* node gives information about the object instance. This "
"can be useful to give some variation to a single material assigned to "
"multiple instances, either manually controlled through the object index, "
"based on the object location, or randomized for each instance. For "
"example a Noise texture can give random colors or a Color ramp can give a"
" range of colors to be randomly picked from."
