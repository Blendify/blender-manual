"To use the option, enable it in the render layers tab of the properties "
"editor. On rendering, it will denoise tile by tile once all the "
"surrounding tiles are finished rendering. The default settings fit a wide"
" range of scenes, but the user can tweak individual settings to control "
"the tradeoff between a noise-free image, image details, and calculation "
"time."

"Setting the radius too high is generally not advisable. It increases "
