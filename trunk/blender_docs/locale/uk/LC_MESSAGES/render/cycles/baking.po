"The baking happens into the respective active textures of the object "
"materials. The active texture is the last selected Image Texture node of "
"the material node tree. That means the active object (or the selected "
"objects, when not baking 'Selected to Active') needs a material, and that"
" material needs at least an Image Texture node, with the image to be used"
" for the baking. Note, the node does not need to be connected to any "
"other node. The active texture is what projection painting and the "
"viewport use as a criteria to which image to use. This way after the "
"baking is done you can automatically preview the baked result in the "
"Texture mode."
