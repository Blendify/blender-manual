":abbr:`GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)` rendering makes it possible to use"
" your graphics card for rendering, instead of the CPU. This can speed up "
"rendering, because modern GPUs are designed to do quite a lot of number "
"crunching. On the other hand, they also have some limitations in "
"rendering complex scenes, due to more limited memory, and issues with "
"interactivity when using the same graphics card for display and "
"rendering."

msgid "Why is Blender unresponsive during rendering?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/gpu_rendering.rst:72
msgid ""
"While a graphics card is rendering, it cannot redraw the user interface, "
"which makes Blender unresponsive. We attempt to avoid this problem by "
"giving back control over the GPU as often as possible, but a completely "
"smooth interaction cannot be guaranteed, especially on heavy scenes. This"
" is a limitation of graphics cards for which no true solution exists, "
"though we might be able to improve this somewhat in the future."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/gpu_rendering.rst:78
msgid ""
"If possible, it is best to install more than one GPU, using one for "
"display and the other(s) for rendering."

msgid "Why does a scene that renders on the CPU not render on the GPU?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/gpu_rendering.rst:85
msgid ""
"There maybe be multiple causes, but the most common is that there is not "
"enough memory on your graphics card. We can currently only render scenes "
"that fit in graphics card memory, and this is usually smaller than that "
"of the CPU. Note that, for example, 8k, 4k, 2k and 1k image textures take"
" up respectively 256MB, 64MB, 16MB and 4MB of memory."

"We do intend to add a system to support scenes bigger than GPU memory, "

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/gpu_rendering.rst:110
msgid ""
"Currently Nvidia with CUDA is rendering fastest, but this really depends "
"on the hardware you buy. Currently, CUDA and OpenCL are about the same in"

"If a GPU is used for both display and rendering, MS-Windows has a limit "

"rendering."

"Another solution can be to increase the timeout, although this will make "
