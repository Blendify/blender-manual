msgid ""
"While rendering stills will allow you to view and save the image from the "
"render buffer when it is complete, animations are a series of images, or "
"frames, and are automatically saved directly out to a drive after being "
"rendered."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/workflows/animations.rst:10
msgid ""
"After rendering the frames, you may need to edit the clips, or first use the "
"Compositor to do green-screen masking, matting, color correction, DOF, and "
"so on to the images. That result is then fed to the Sequencer where the "
"strips are cut and mixed and a final overlay is done."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/workflows/animations.rst:15
msgid ""
"Finally you can render out from the Sequencer and compress the frames into a "
"playable movie clip."

msgid "Workflow"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/workflows/animations.rst:21
msgid ""
"Generally, you do a lot of intermediate renders of different frames in your "
"animation to check for timing, lighting, placement, materials, and so on. At "
"some point, you are ready to make a final render of the complete animation "
"for publication."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/workflows/animations.rst:25
msgid ""
"There are two approaches you can use when making a movie, or animation, with "
"or without sound. The approach you should use depends on the amount of CPU "
"time you will need to render the movie. You can render a \"typical\" frame "
"at the desired resolution, and then multiply by the number of frames that "
"will ultimately go into the movie, to arrive at an total render time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/workflows/animations.rst:30
msgid ""
"If the total render time is an hour or more, you want to use the \"Frame "
"Sequence\" approach. For example, if you are rendering an one-minute video "
"clip for film, there will be (60 seconds per minute) X (24 frames per "
"second) or 1440 frames per minute. If each frame takes 30 seconds to render, "
"then you will be able to render two frames per minute, or need 720 minutes "
"(12 hours) of render time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/workflows/animations.rst:37
msgid ""
"Rendering takes all available CPU time; you should render overnight, when "
"the computer is not needed, or set Blender to a low priority while "
"rendering, and work on other things (be careful with the RAM space!)."

msgid "Direct Approach"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/workflows/animations.rst:43
msgid ""
"The Direct Approach, which is highly **not** recommended and not a standard "
"practice, is where you set your output format to an AVI or MOV format, and "
"click *Animation* to render your scene directly out to a movie file. Blender "
"creates one file that holds all the frames of your animation. You can then "
"use Blender's VSE to add an audio track to the animation and render out to "
"an MPEG format to complete your movie."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/workflows/animations.rst:51
msgid "Frame Sequence"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/workflows/animations.rst:52
msgid ""
"The Frame Sequence is a much more stable approach, where you set your output "
"format to a still format (such as JPG, PNG or MultiLayer), and click "
"*Animation* to render your scene out to a set of images, where each image is "
"a frame in the sequence."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/workflows/animations.rst:57
msgid ""
"Blender creates a file for each frame of the animation. You can then use "
"Blender's compositor to perform any frame manipulation (post processing). "
"You can then use Blender's VSE to load that final image sequence, add an "
"audio track to the animation, and render out to an MPEG format to complete "
"your movie. The Frame Sequence approach is a little more complicated and "
"takes more drive space, but gives you more flexibility."

msgid ""
"Once the animation is finished, use your OS file explorer to navigate into "
"the output folder (\"``render`` in this example). You will see lots of "

"Why go through all this hassle? Well, first of all, if you render out single "
"frames you can stop the render at any time by pressing :kbd:`Esc` in the "
"render window or UV/image editor. You will not lose the frames you have "
"already rendered, since they have been written out to individual files. You "
"can always adjust the range you want to continue from where you left off."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/workflows/animations.rst:120

"You can edit the frames afterwards and post-process them. You can add neat "

"get different file sizes and quality) with almost no effort whatsoever."

"Unless your animation renders in a few minutes, it is best to render the "
