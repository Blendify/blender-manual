"Procedural textures are textures that are defined mathematically. They "
"are generally relatively simple to use, because they do not need to be "
"mapped in a special way. This does not mean that procedural textures "
"cannot become very complex."

"These types of textures are 'real' 3D. By that we mean that they fit "
"together perfectly at the edges and continue to look like what they are "
"meant to look like even when they are cut; as if a block of wood had "
"really been cut in two. Procedural textures are not filtered or anti-"
"aliased. This is hardly ever a problem: the user can easily keep the "
"specified frequencies within acceptable limits."
