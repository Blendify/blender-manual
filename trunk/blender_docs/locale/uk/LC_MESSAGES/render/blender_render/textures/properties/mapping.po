"UV mapping is a very precise way of mapping a 2D texture to a 3D surface."
" Each vertex of a mesh has its own UV co-ordinates which can be unwrapped"
" and laid flat like a skin. You can almost think of UV coordinates as a "
"mapping that works on a 2D plane with its own local coordinate system to "
"the plane on which it is operating on. This mapping is especially useful "
"when using 2D images as textures, as seen in :ref:`UV Mapping <editors-"
"uv-image-index>`. You can use multiple textures with one set of UV "
