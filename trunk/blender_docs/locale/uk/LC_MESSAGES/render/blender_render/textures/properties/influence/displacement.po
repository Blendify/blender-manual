"Displacement mapping allows a texture input to manipulate the position of"
" vertices on rendered geometry. Unlike :doc:`Normal or Bump mapping "
"</render/blender_render/textures/properties/influence/bump_and_normal>`, "
"where the shading is distorted to give an illusion of a bump (discussed "
"on the previous page), Displacement Maps create real bumps, creases, "
"ridges, etc in the actual mesh. Thus, the mesh deformations can cast "
"shadows, occlude other objects, and do everything that changes in real "
"geometry can do, but, on the other hand, requires a lot more vertices to "
"work."

"If a texture provides only intensity information (e.g. *Magic*, derived "
"from color), vertices move along the directions of their normals (a "
"vertex has no normal itself, it is the resulting vector of the adjacent "
"faces). White pixels move outward in the direction of the normal, black "
"pixels move in the opposite direction. The amount of displacement is "
"controlled with the *Displace* slider."

"The two modes are not exclusive. Many texture types provide both "
"information (*Clouds*, *Wood*, *Marble*, *Image*). The amount of each "
"type can be mixed using the respective sliders. Intensity displacement "
"gives a smoother, more continuous surface, since the vertices are "
"displaced only outward. Normal displacement gives a more aggregated "
"surface, since the vertices are displaced in multiple directions."

"The depth of the displacement is scaled with an object's scale, but not "
"with the relative size of the data. This means if you double the size of "
"an object in object mode, the depth of the displacement is also doubled, "
"so the relative displacement appears the same. If you scale inside *Edit "
"Mode*, the displacement depth is not changed, and thus the relative depth"
" appears smaller."

"Displacement maps move the rendered faces, not the physical mesh faces. "
"So, in 3D View the surface may appear smooth, but render bumpy. To give a"
" detailed surface, there has to be faces to displace and have to be very "
"small. This creates the trade-off between using memory and CPU time "
"versus render quality."
