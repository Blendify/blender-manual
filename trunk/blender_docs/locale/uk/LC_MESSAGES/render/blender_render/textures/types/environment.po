"Environment maps take a render of the 3D scene and apply it to a texture,"
" to use for faking reflections. If you want to achieve a very realistic "
"result, raytraced reflections are a good solution. Environment Maps are "
"another way to create reflective surfaces, but they are not so simple to "
"set up."

"The main reason is probably that they can be much faster than raytracing "
"reflections. In certain situations they need to be calculated only once, "
"and may be reused like any ordinary texture. You may even modify the "
"precalculated Environment Map in an image editor."

"Environment maps can also be blurred and render even faster because the "

"Just as we render the light that reaches the viewing plane using the "
"camera to define a viewpoint, we can render the light that reaches the "
"surface of an object (and hence, the light that might ultimately be "
"reflected to the camera). Blender's environment mapping renders a cubic "
"image map of the scene in the six cardinal directions from any point. "
"When the six tiles of the image are mapped onto an object using the "
"*Reflection* input coordinates, they create the visual complexity that "
"the eye expects to see from shiny reflections."

"expects. The most unbelievable thing about most rendered images is the "
"sterility, not the inaccuracy."
