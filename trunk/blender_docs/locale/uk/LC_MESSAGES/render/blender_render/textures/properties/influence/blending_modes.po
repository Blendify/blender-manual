"Blending Modes are different methods of controlling how the texture "
"influences material properties. While a blending mode defines the "
"specific operation performed, blending factor controls the amount, the "
"overall \"strength\" of this operation. For textures such blending factor"
" is set via sliders in the Influence panel."

"The active texture is used as a mask for all following textures. This is "

"If you want transparent material, and use a texture mapped to *Alpha*, "
"nothing happens with the default settings, because the *Alpha* value in "
"the *Material* panel is 1. So you have to set *DVar* to 0 to get "
"transparent material (and of course *Z Transparency* also). This is a "
"common problem for beginners. Or do it the other way round: set *Alpha* "
"to 0 and leave *Dvar* on 1. Of course the texture is used inverted then."
