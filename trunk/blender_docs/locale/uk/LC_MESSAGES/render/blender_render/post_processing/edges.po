"Blender's toon shaders can give your rendering a comic-book-like or manga-"
"like appearance, affecting the shades of colors. The effect is not perfect "
"since real comics and manga also usually have china ink outlines. Blender "
"can add this feature as a post-processing operation."

"The threshold of the angle between faces for drawing edges, from 0 to 255. A "
"value of 10 would just give outline of object against the background, "
"whereas higher settings start to add outlines on surface edges, starting "
"with sharper angles. At maximum intensity, edge will even faintly display "
"geometry subdivided edge lines in areas of imperfect smoothing."

"It is possible to separate out the edge layer using a render layer dedicated "
"to that purpose. The alpha channel is 0 where there is no edge, and 1 where "
"the edge is. By separating out the edge layer, you can blur it, change its "
"color, mask it, etc. The image above shows how to do this. In this example, "
"an Edge render layer is created that only has the Sky and Edge layers The "
"other render layer omits the Edge layer, so it returns just the normal "
"image. On the output panel *Edge* is enabled with a width of 10 in black. "
"Then that layer goes through a blur node. Using the Alpha Over node, then "
"the cube is composited on top of the blurred edge. The result gives a soft-"
"shadow kind of effect. Note that Premultiply is set, because the Edge image "
"already has an alpha of 1.0 set."
