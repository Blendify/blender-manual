"The TV standards prescribe that there should be 25 frames per second (PAL) "
"or 30 frames per second (NTSC). Since the phosphors of the screen do not "
"maintain luminosity for very long, this could produce a noticeable "
"flickering."

msgid ""
"To minimize this, a TV does not represent frames as a computer does "
"('progressive' mode), but rather represents half-frames, or *fields* at a "
"double refresh rate, hence 50 half frames per second on PAL and 60 half "
"frames per second on NTSC. This was originally bound to the frequency of "
"power lines in Europe (50Hz) and the US (60Hz)."

"In particular, fields are \"interlaced\" in the sense that one field "
"presents all the even lines of the complete frame and the subsequent field "
"the odd ones."

"Since there is a non-negligible time difference between each field (1/50 or "
"1/60 of a second) merely rendering a frame the usual way and splitting it "
"into two half frames does not work. A noticeable jitter of the edges of "
"moving objects would be present."

"Enable field rendering. When the *Fields* button in the *Render* Panel is "
"pressed (*Post Processing* section), Blender prepares each frame in two "
"passes. On the first it renders only the even lines, then it advances in "
"time by half a time step and renders all the odd lines. This produces odd "
"results on a PC screen (Field Rendering result). but will show correctly on "
"a TV set."

"If you are really confused, a simple trick to determine the correct field "
"order is to render a short test animation of a white square moving from left "
"to right on a black background. Prepare one version with odd field order and "
"another with even field order, and look at them on a television screen. The "
"one with the right field order will look smooth and the other one horrible. "
"Doing this simple test will save you *hours* of wasted rendering time..."

"Nodes are currently not field-aware. This is partly due to the fact that in "
"fields, too much information is missing to do good neighborhood operations "
"(blur, vector blur etc.). The solution is to render your animation at double "
"the frame rate without fields and do the interlacing of the footage "
"afterwards."
