"Many organic and inorganic materials are not totally opaque right at the "
"surface, so light does not just bounce off the top surface. Instead, some"
" light also penetrates the skin surface deeply, and scatters around "
"inside, taking on the color of the insides and emerging back out at a "
"different location. Human/animal skin, the skin of grapes, tomatoes, "
"fruits, wax, gels (like honey, or Jello) and so on all have subsurface "
"scattering (SSS), and photo-realism really cannot be achieved without it."

"At first the irradiance, or brightness, of the surface is calculated, "

"In the second step, the final image is rendered, but now the SSS shader "
"replaces the diffuse shader. Instead of the lamps, the calculated "
"lightmap is used. The brightness of a surface point is the calculated "
"\"Average\" of the brightness of its surrounding points. Depending on "
"your settings the whole surface may be taken into account, and it is a "
"bit more complicated than simply calculating the average, but do not "

"Because of the way this scattering is calculated, when using large radius"

"This is not in fact the radius of the subsurface scattering, but the "

"travels between each bounce. The longer the path length is, the further "
"the light is allowed to scatter. This is the main source of a material's "
"perceived \"scatter color.\" A material like skin will have a higher red "
"radius than green and blue. Subsurface scattering is the diffusion of "
"light beneath the surface. You control how far the light spreads to "
