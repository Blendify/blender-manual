"In addition to creating materials as just described using all the "
"settings on all the materials panels, Blender allows you to create a "
"material by routing basic materials through a set of nodes. Each node "
"performs some operation on the material, changing how it will appear when"
" applied to the mesh, and passes it on to the next node. In this way, "
"very complex material appearances can be achieved."

"You should already be familiar with general material concepts and how to "
"create materials/textures using the material menu. You should also have a"
" general understanding of the texture coordinate systems available in "
"Blender (e.g. Generated, UV, etc.). Also, many aspects of a node will be "
"skipped here because in later sections you will see the function expanded"
" upon. Each section builds off the previous."

"To start, the node system does not make the material menu obsolete. Many "
"features and material settings are still only accessible through the "
"material panel (e.g. Ray Mirror). However, with the advent of nodes, more"
" complex and fantastic materials can be created since we now have greater"
" control."

"Just in case you are not (yet) familiar with the concepts: when you "
"create a system of nodes, you are describing a data-processing pipeline "
"of sorts, where data \"flows from\" nodes which describe various "
"*sources,* \"flows through\" nodes which represent various processing and"
" filtering stages, and finally \"flows into\" nodes which represent "
"outputs or destinations. You can connect the nodes to one another in many"
" different ways, and you can adjust \"knobs, \" or parameters, that "
"control the behavior of each node. This gives you a tremendous amount of "
"creative control. And, it will very quickly become intuitive."

"Here we have the standard material we have added to a cube mesh. We "
"could, as we have in the past, add color and other settings to this "
"material and it would certainly look nice. But let us say we are just not"
" getting what we are looking for? What if we want to control the creation"
" more tightly or add more complexity? Here is where nodes come in."
