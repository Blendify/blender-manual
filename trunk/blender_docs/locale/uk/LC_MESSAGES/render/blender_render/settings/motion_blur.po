"Blender's animations are by default rendered as a sequence of *perfectly "
"still* images. While great for stop-motion and time-lapses, this is "
"unrealistic, since fast-moving objects do appear to be blurred in the "
"direction of motion, both in a movie frame and in a photograph from a real-"
"world camera."

"Blender can be made to render the current frame and some more 'virtual' "

"obtain an image where moving objects are 'blurred'."

"This method is slow, but produces good results. It can be activated in the "
"*Sampled Motion Blur* panel of the render settings. This kind of motion blur "
"is done during the render."

"Time (in frames) the shutter is open. If you are rendering at 24 fps, and "

"Samples are taken only from the *next* frame, not the previous one. "

"Vector blur is a process done in compositing (post-render time), by "
"rendering the scene without any blur, plus a pass that has movement "
"information for each pixel. This information is a vector map which describes "
"a 2D or 3D direction and magnitude. The compositor uses that data to blur "
"each pixel in the given direction."

"Values greater than 1 are physically impossible in a real-world camera, but "
"can be used to exaggerate the effect. Better results than those shown can be "
"obtained by using higher samples than 8, but, of course, since as many "
"*separate* renders as samples are needed, a Motion Blur render takes that "
"many times more time than a non-Motion Blur one."
