"\"A watched pot never boils\" is the old saying, but you may wonder why "
"your render takes so long to create, or worse, crashes mid-way through! "
"Well, there is lots going on and lots you can do to speed up rendering or"
" enable a complicated render to complete. Also, it is possible to render "
"a very complicated scene on a mediocre PC by being \"render-smart\". Here"
" is a \"top ten\" list of things to do or not do in order to speed up "
"rendering or even avoid crashes during scene render. Some options may "
"decrease the quality of your render, but for draft renders you may not "

"Switch to an Orthographic camera, and render your own \"parts\" of the "
"scene as separate images, and then paste those parts together in GIMP. An"
" old trick in making your own panorama with a real camera is to take "
"three or so pictures of a very wide (beach sunset) scene, where you take "
"one picture, rotate to the right, snap another, then another, and when "
"you get the pictures developed, you overlap them to make a very wide "
"landscape image. Do the same in Blender: render out one shot to a file, "
"then move the camera to look at a different area of the scene, and render"
" that shot. Each shot will be of a smaller area and thus take in fewer "
"polygons/faces. Be sure that when you position your camera that you snap "
"overlapping shots, so that you can then match them up. If you do not want"
" to use GIMP, you can use compositing nodes and the Translate node to "
"match them up in Blender."

"This is a very familiar idea. Modern sound recordings, for example, "
