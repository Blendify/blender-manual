"Many factors go into the quality of the rendered image. Rendering a scene "
"without changing any of the render settings is probably going to produce a "
"rather unpleasant image. In previous chapters, you have learned how to "
"model, shade, texture, and light scenes. Optimizing settings with respect to "
"those areas will help to produce quality images, but there are some "
"important settings that come into play before pressing the render button. "
"These can directly affect the look of the rendered image."

"The next section covers render layers and render passes, both of which allow "
"you to compose an image from several elements of a scene. In some cases it "
"is necessary to render effects straight out of the renderer, rather than "
"creating them in \"post.\""

msgid ""
"One important aspect of 3D rendering that is often overlooked is color "
"management. Without color management, or more commonly, linear rendering, "
"render engines interpret scene lighting correctly, but display them "
"incorrectly on your monitor. Blender simplifies this workflow, but it is "
"important to know how the color space of a rendered image factors into your "
"pipeline."

"Anti-Aliasing removes jagged edges that appear in contrasting areas of "
"color. This is a very important aspect of render quality. Without this "
"render setting, images usually appear particularly CG and amateur."

"Exposure is, in physical terms, the length of time a camera's film or sensor "
"is exposed to light. Longer exposure times create a brighter image. In CG, "
"the recorded light values are offset to simulate longer or shorter "
"exposures. This can be achieved through lighting settings, or better, "

#: ../../manual/render/blender_render/optimizations/quality.rst:62
msgid ""
"Cameras have a certain shutter speed (the length of time the film is exposed "
"to the lights of the scene). Things that are in motion while the picture is "
"taken will have some degree of blurring. Faster-moving objects will appear "
"more blurred than slower objects. This is an important effect in CG because "
"it is an artifact that we expect to see, and when it is missing, an image "
"may not be believable."
