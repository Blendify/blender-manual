"Light would not even exist without its counterpart: shadows. Shadows are "
"a darkening of a portion of an object because light is being partially or"
" totally blocked from illuminating the object. They add contrast and "
"volume to a scene; there is nearly no place in the real world without "
"shadows, so to get realistic renders, you will need them. Blender "
"supports the following kinds of shadows:"

"Ambient occlusion really is not a shadow based on light *per se*, but "
"based on geometry. However, it does mimic an effect where light is "
"prevented from fully and uniformly illuminating an object, so it is "
"mentioned here. Also, it is important to mention ambient lighting, since "
"increasing *Ambient* decreases the effect of a shadow."

"You can use a combination of ray-traced and buffer shadows to achieve "

"As opposed to buffered shadows (`Lamps: Buffered Shadows`_), ray-traced "
