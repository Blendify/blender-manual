"Lighting is a very important topic in rendering, standing equal to modeling, "
"materials and textures. The most accurately modeled and textured scene will "
"yield poor results without a proper lighting scheme, while a simple model "
"can become very realistic if skillfully lit."

"The physics of light bouncing around in the real world is simulated by "
"Ambient Occlusion (a world setting), buffer shadows (which approximate "
"shadows being cast by objects), ray tracing (which traces the path of "
"photons from a light source). Also, within Blender you can use :doc:"
"`Indirect lighting </render/blender_render/world/indirect_lighting>`. Ray "
"tracing, ambient occlusion, and indirect lighting are computer-intensive "
"processes. Blender can perform much faster rendering with its internal scan "
"line renderer, which is a very good scan line renderer indeed. This kind of "
"rendering engine is much faster since it does not try to simulate the real "
"behavior of light, assuming many simplifying hypotheses."
