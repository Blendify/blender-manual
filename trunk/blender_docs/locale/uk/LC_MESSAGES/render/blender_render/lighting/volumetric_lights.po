"\"Volumetric lighting is a technique used in 3D computer graphics to add "
"lighting effects to a rendered scene. It allows the viewer to see beams "
"of light shining through the environment; seeing sunbeams streaming "
"through an open window is an example of volumetric lighting, also known "
"as God rays. The term seems to have been introduced from cinematography "
"and is now widely applied to 3D modeling and rendering especially in the "
"field of 3D gaming. In volumetric lighting, the light cone emitted by a "
"light source is modeled as a transparent object and considered as a "
"container of a \"volume\": as a result, light has the capability to give "
"the effect of passing through an actual three dimensional medium (such as"
" fog, dust, smoke, or steam) that is inside its volume, just like in the "
"real world.\""

"A classic example is the search light with a visible halo/shaft of light "
"being emitted from it as the search light sweeps around."

"By default Blender does not model this aspect of light. For example when "
"Blender lights something with a *Spot* light, you see the objects and "
"area on the floor lit but not the shaft/halo of light coming from the "
"spotlight as it progresses to its target and would get scattered on the "
"way."

"The halo/shaft of light is caused in the real world by light being "
"scattered by particles in the air, some of which get diverted into your "
"eye and that you perceive as a halo/shaft of light. The scattering of "
"light from a source can be simulated in Blender using various options, "
"but by default is not activated."

"The only lamp able to create volumetric effects is the :doc:`Spot lamp "
