"The *Spot* light is the most complex of the light objects and indeed, for"
" a long time, among the most used thanks to the fact that it was the only"
" one able to cast shadows. Nowadays, with a ray tracer integrated into "
"Blender's internal render engine, all lamps can cast shadows (except "
"*Hemi*). Even so, *Spot* lamps' shadow buffers are much faster to render "
"than ray-traced shadows, especially when blurred/softened, and spot lamps"
" also provide other functionality such as \"volumetric\" halos."

"*Buffered Shadows* are also known as depth map shadows. Shadows are "

"</render/blender_render/lighting/lamps/spot/buffered_shadows>` for full "
"details on using this feature. Buffered shadows are more complex to set "
"up and involve more faking, but the speed of rendering is a definite "
