"When a new lamp is added, it produces light in a uniform, flat color. "
"While this might be sufficient in simple renderings, more sophisticated "
"effects can be accomplished through the use of :doc:`textures "
"</render/blender_render/textures/index>`. Subtle textures can add visual "
"nuance to a lamp, while hard textures can be used to simulate more "
"pronounced effects, such as a disco ball, dappled sunlight breaking "
"through treetops, or even a projector. These textures are assigned to one"
" of ten channels, and behave exactly like material textures, except that "
"they affect a lamp's color and intensity, rather than a material's "
"surface characteristics."

"The lamp textures settings are grouped into two panels. Here we will only"
" talk about the few things that differ from object material textures; see"
" the :doc:`Materials </render/blender_render/materials/index>` and "
":doc:`Textures </render/blender_render/textures/index>` chapters for "
"details about the standard options."

"The texture-specific and the *Mapping* panels remain the same. However, "
"you will note there are much fewer *Mapping* options. You can only choose"
" between *Global*, *View* or another *Object* 's texture *coordinates* "
"(since a lamp has no texture coordinates by itself), and you can scale or"
" offset the texture."

"The *Mapping* panel is also a subset of its regular material's "
"counterpart. You can only map a lamp texture to its regular, basic "
"*Color* and/or to its *Shadow* color. As you can only affect colors, and "
"a lamp has no texture coordinates on its own, the *Diffuse*, *Specular*, "
"*Shading*, and *Geometry* options have disappeared."
