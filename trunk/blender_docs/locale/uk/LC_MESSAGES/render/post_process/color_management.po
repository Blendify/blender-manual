"Color management is one of the most important tools that an artist can use. "
"It allows an artist to make sure that an image stays the same from "
"rendering, to saving, to post processing. Color management also allows an "
"artist to tweak things like exposure, gamma, or the overall color grade."

"To achieve color management in Blender, the `OpenColorIO <http://opencolorio."
"org/>`__ (OCIO) library has been integrated into Blender. This library "
"offers fine control over different :abbr:`LUT (Look Up Table)` along with "
"integrating your own set of color profiles to keep your work linearized with "
"other software."

"For correct results, different :term:`color spaces <color space>` are needed "

"best done in scene *linear* color space, which corresponds more closely to "
"nature, and makes computations more physically accurate."

"If the colors are linear, it means that if in reality, we double the number "
"of photons, the color values are also doubled. Put another way, if we have "
"two photos/renders each with one of two lights on, and add those images "
"together, the result would be the same as a render/photo with both lights "
"on. It follows that such a radiometrically linear space is best for photo-"
"realistic rendering and compositing."

"However, these values do not directly correspond to human perception or the "

"There is also an artistic choice to be made for renders. Partially that is "
