msgid ""
"Dithering is a technique for blurring pixels to prevent banding that is seen "
"in areas of gradients, where stair-stepping appears between colors. Banding "
"artifacts are more noticeable when gradients are longer, or less steep. "
"Dithering was developed for graphics with low bit depths, meaning they had a "
"limited range of possible colors."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/post_process/panel.rst:37
msgid ""
"Dithering works by taking pixel values and comparing them with a threshold "
"and neighboring pixels then does calculations to generate the appropriate "
"color. Dithering creates the perceived effect of a larger color palette by "
"creating a sort of visual color mixing. For example, if you take a grid and "
"distribute red and yellow pixels evenly across it, the image would appear to "
"be orange."
