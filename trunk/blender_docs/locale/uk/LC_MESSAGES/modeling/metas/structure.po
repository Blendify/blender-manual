"A more formal definition of a meta object can be given as a *directing "
"structure* which can be seen as the source of a static field. The field can "
"be either positive or negative and hence the field generated by neighboring "
"directing structures can attract or repel."

#: ../../manual/modeling/metas/structure.rst:13
msgid ""
"The implicit surface is defined as the surface where the 3D field generated "
"by all the directing structures assume a given value. For example a meta "
"ball, whose directing structure is a point, generates an isotropic (i.e. "
"identical in all directions) field around it and the surfaces at constant "
"field value are spheres centered at the directing point."

"*Meta* objects are nothing more than mathematical formula that perform "
"logical operations on one another (AND, OR), and that can be added and "
"subtracted from each other. This method is also called *Constructive Solid "
"Geometry* (CSG). Because of its mathematical nature, CSG uses little memory, "
"but requires lots of processing power to compute."
