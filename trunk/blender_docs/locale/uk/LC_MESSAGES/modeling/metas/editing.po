msgid ""
"Scaling the inner green circle changes the *Stiffness* value. Stiffness "
"defines how much the meta object is filled. This essentially defines how "
"sensitive a meta is to being affected by other metas. With a low stiffness, "
"the meta will begin to deform from further away. A higher value means the "
"meta needs to be close to another one to begin merging."

"When a *Meta* object comes within \"range\" of another meta, the two will "
"begin to interact with each other. They do not necessarily need to "

"The range is from (0.0 to 10.0). But to be visible, the *Stiffness* must be "

"A family is defined by the left part of an object's name (the one before the "

"panels, **not** the *MB* field, which is the meta data-block's name... For "
"example, the *family* part of \"MetaPlane.001\" is ``MetaPlane``. Each meta "

"Families of metas are controlled by a *base* meta object which is identified "

"\"MetaThing.003\" and \"MetaThing.004\", the *base* meta object would be "
"\"MetaThing\"."

"The *base* meta object determines the basis, the resolution, the threshold, "

"Fig. :ref:`fig-meta-ball-base` shows the *base* meta labeled \"B\". The "
"other two *Meta* objects are *children*. Children's selection rings are "
"always black, while the group's mesh is orange. Because the metas are "
"grouped, they form a unified mesh which can always be selected by selecting "
"the mesh of any meta in the group. For example, in Fig. :ref:`fig-meta-ball-"
"base`, only the lower sphere (the parent) has been selected, and you see "

msgid ""
"The *base* meta object controls the *polygonalization* (mesh structure) for "
"the group, and as such, also controls the polygonalization for the children "
"(non-base) metas. If we transform the *base* meta, the children's "
"polygonalization changes. However, if we transform the children, the "
"polygonalization remains unchanged."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This discussion of \"polygonization\" does *not* mean that the various "
"meshes do not deform towards or away from each other (meta objects always "
"influence one another in the usual way, whether or not they are members of "
"the same family). Rather, it means that the underlying mesh structure "
"changes only when the *base* object transforms. For example, if you scale "
"the *base*, the children's mesh structure changes. In Fig. :ref:`fig-meta-"
"ball-scale`, the *base* has been scaled down, which has the effect of "
"scaling the mesh structure of each of the children. As you can see, the "
"children's mesh resolution has increased, while the *base* decreased. The "
"children did *not* change size!"
