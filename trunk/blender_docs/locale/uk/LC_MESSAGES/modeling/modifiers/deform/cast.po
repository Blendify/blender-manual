"any of a few pre-defined shapes (sphere, cylinder, cuboid)."

"It is equivalent to the *To Sphere* tool in *Edit Mode* "
":menuselection:`Mesh --> Transform --> To Sphere`, :kbd:`Alt-Shift-S` and"
" what other programs call \"Spherify\" or \"Spherize\", but, as written "

"look nicer or even to fix shading artifacts."

"The factor to control blending between original and cast vertex "

"(i.e. modifier has no effect), 1.0 casts to the target shape. Values "
