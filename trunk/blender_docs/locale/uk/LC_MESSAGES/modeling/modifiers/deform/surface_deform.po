"The Surface Deform Modifier allows an arbitrary mesh surface to control "
"the deformation of another, essentially transferring its "
"motion/deformation. One great use for this is to have a proxy mesh for "
"cloth simulation, which will in turn drive the motion of your final and "
"more detailed mesh, which would otherwise not be suitable for simulation."

"How much a vertex bound to one face of the target will be affected by the"

"Bind the current state of the modified mesh to the current state of the "

"The meshes are bound with regard to global coordinates, but later "
"transformations on the objects are ignored. This means that one can "
"freely transform the target or modified object after binding, without "
"affecting the modified object. The modified mesh will only pick up "
"changes to the target object's mesh itself."

"The further a mesh deviates from the target mesh surface, the more likely"
" it is to get undesirable artifacts. This is an inherent characteristic "
"of surface binding in general, so it is recommended to have reasonably "
"well matching meshes, in order to get a good bind."
