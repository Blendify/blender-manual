"The Build Modifier is often useful when needing a way to get a large number "
"of items to progressively appear, without resorting to animating the "
"visibility of each one by one. Examples of this include a mesh containing "
"vertices only, which is used as a duplivert emitter, and has the build "
"modifier on it. Such a setup is a workaround/technique for being able to art-"
"direct some semi-random layout of a collection of objects (i.e. leaves/balls "
"forming a carpet of sorts) when doing so with particles is not desirable (e."
"g. due to undesirable distribution of items leaving random gaps and "
"overlapping in other places)."
