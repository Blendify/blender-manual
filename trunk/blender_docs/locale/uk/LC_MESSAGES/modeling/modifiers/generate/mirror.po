"Many modeling tasks involve creating objects that are symmetrical. "

"without using one of the workarounds that have been discovered by clever "
"Blender artists over the years. A common technique was to model one half "
"of an object and use :kbd:`Alt-D` to create a linked duplicate which can "
"then be scaled on one axis by -1 to produce a perfect mirror-image copy "
"which updates in real time as you edit."
