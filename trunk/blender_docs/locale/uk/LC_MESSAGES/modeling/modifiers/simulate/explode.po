"The Explode Modifier is used to alter the mesh geometry by moving/rotating "
"its faces in a way that roughly tracks particles emitted by that object, "
"making it look as if the mesh is being exploded (broken apart and pushed "
"outward)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/simulate/explode.rst:10
msgid ""
"For the Explode Modifier to have a visible effect, there needs to be "
"particle system on it. The particle system on the mesh is what controls how "
"the mesh will be exploded, and therefore without the particle system the "
"mesh will not appear to alter."

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/simulate/explode.rst:14

"Both the number of emitted particles and number of faces determine how "
"granular the Explode Modifier will be. More faces and more particles will "
"mean more individual pieces."
