"The \"Empty\" is a single coordinate point with no additional geometry. "
"Because an Empty has no volume and surface, it cannot be rendered. Still it "
"can be used as a handle for many purposes."

msgid ""
"While Empties don't exactly have any object data attached to them which can "
"be used for supporting \"true\" apply scale (i.e. with non-uniform scaling), "
"they do have a draw size value which controls how large the empties are "
"drawn (before scaling). This works by taking the scale factor on the most-"
"scaled axis, and combines this with the existing empty draw size to maintain "
"the correct dimensions on that axis."
