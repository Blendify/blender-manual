"Vertex Groups are mainly used to tag the vertices belonging to parts of a"
" Mesh Object or :term:`Lattice`. Think of the legs of a chair or the "
"hinges of a door, or hands, arms, limbs, head, feet, etc. of a character."
" In addition you can assign different *weight values* (in the range [ "
"0.0, 1.0 ] ) to the vertices within a Vertex Group. Hence Vertex Groups "
"are sometimes also named *Weight Groups*."

msgid ""
"If you want to animate your mesh and make it move, you will define an "
"armature which consists of a bunch of bones. Vertex Groups are used to "
"associate parts of the Mesh to Bones of the Armature, where you can "
"specify an influence *weight* in the range (0.0 - 1.0) for each vertex in"
" the Vertex Group."

msgid ""
"Obviously, the same vertex can belong to several groups, and hence be "
"affected by several bones, with a fine tuning of each bone's influence "
"using these vertex weights. Quite useful when you want to have a smooth "
"joint. For example, when you skin an elbow, the upperarm vertex group "
"contains the vertices of this part at full weight (*1.0*), and when "
"reaching the elbow area, these weights decrease progressively to *0.0* "
"when reaching the forearm zone and vice versa for the forearm group "
"weights... Of course, this is a very raw example skinning a realistic "
"joint is a big job, as you have to carefully find good weights for each "
"vertex, to have the most realistic behavior, when bending -- and this is "
"not an easy thing!"

"Many modifiers contain the ability to control the modifier influence on "
