"Note that loops (2 and 4) do not go around the whole model. Loops stop at"
" so called poles because there is no unique way to continue a loop from a"

"edges are not poles."

"In the image above, loops that do not end in poles are cyclic (1 and 3). "

" start and end vertex in case of poles)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/structure.rst:102
msgid ""
"Edge Loops are an important concept especially in organic (subsurface) "
"modeling and character animation. When used correctly, they allow you to "
"build models with relatively few vertices that look very natural when "
"used as subdivision surfaces and deform very well in animation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Take Fig. :ref:`fig-mesh-topo-loop` in organic modeling as an example: "
"the edge loops follow the natural contours and deformation lines of the "
"skin and the underlying muscles and are more dense in areas that deform "
"more when the character moves, for example at the shoulders or knees."

"containing the poles are not included in a Face Loop."

#~ "A simple way to create a new "

#~ "in *Edit Mode*. Of course, as a"
#~ " computer screen is two-dimensional, "
#~ "Blender cannot determine all three "
#~ "vertex coordinates from a single mouse"
#~ " click, so the new vertex is "
#~ "placed at the depth of the 3D "
#~ "cursor. Using the method described "
#~ "above, any vertices selected previously "
#~ "are automatically connected to the new"
#~ " ones by an edge. In the image"
#~ " above, the vertex labeled \"C\" is"
#~ " a new vertex added to the cube"

#~ "Une façon simple de créer un "

#~ "sûr, comme un écran d'ordinateur est "
#~ "en deux dimensions, Blender ne peut "
#~ "pas déterminer les trois coordonnées "
#~ "d'un sommet à partir d'un seul "
#~ "clic de souris, aussi le nouveau "
#~ "sommet est placé à la profondeur "
#~ "du curseur 3D. En utilisant la "
#~ "méthode décrite ci-dessus, tous les "
#~ "sommets précédemment sélectionnés sont "
#~ "automatiquement connectés aux nouveaux par "
