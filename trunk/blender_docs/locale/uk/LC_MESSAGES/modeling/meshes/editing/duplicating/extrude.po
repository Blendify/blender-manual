"First, the algorithm determines the outside edge-loop of the extrude; "

"default (see below), the algorithm considers edges belonging to two or "
"more selected faces as internal, and hence not part of the loop."

"If the edges in the edge-loop belong to only one face in the complete "

"newly created faces. For example, rectangles will result in "
"parallelepipeds during this stage."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/editing/duplicating/extrude.rst:79
msgid ""
"In other cases, the selected faces are linked to the newly created faces "
"but not duplicated. This prevents undesired faces from being retained "
"\"inside\" the resulting mesh. This distinction is extremely important "
"since it ensures the construction of consistently coherent, closed "
"volumes at all times when using *Extrude*."

"*Extrude Individual* allows you to extrude a selection of multiple faces "
