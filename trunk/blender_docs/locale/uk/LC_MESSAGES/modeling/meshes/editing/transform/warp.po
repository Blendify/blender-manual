"In *Edit Mode*, the *Warp* transformation takes selected elements and "
"warps them around the 3D cursor by a certain angle. Note that this "
"transformation is always dependent on the location of the 3D cursor. The "
"Pivot Point is not taken into account. The results of the *Warp* "

"In *Object Mode*, the *Warp* transformation takes the selected Objects "
"and causes them to move in an orbit-like fashion around the 3D cursor. "
