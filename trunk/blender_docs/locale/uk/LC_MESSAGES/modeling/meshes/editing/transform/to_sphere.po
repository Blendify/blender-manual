"Select the elements you want to operate on and activate the *To Sphere* "
"transform function. The *To Sphere* option can be invoked from the "
":menuselection:`Mesh --> Transform --> To Sphere` menu option or by "
"pressing :kbd:`Shift-Alt-S`. The amount of sphericity given to the "
"selection can be determined interactively by moving the mouse or by "
"typing a number between 0 and 1. Pressing :kbd:`Enter` will confirm the "
"transformation. The confirmed transformation can be further edited by "
"pressing :kbd:`F6` or by going into the *Tool Shelf* and altering the "
"*Factor* slider provided that no other actions take place between the *To"
" Sphere* transform confirmation and accessing the slider."
