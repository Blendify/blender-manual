"The *X-mirror* option of the *Mesh Options* panel allows you edit "
"symmetrical vertices on the other side of the mesh in a single action. "
"When you transform an element (vertex, edge or face), if there is its "
"exact X-mirrored counterpart (in local space), it will be transformed "
"accordingly, through a symmetry along the local X axis."

"When using the *X Mirror* option to work on mirrored Mesh Geometry the "

"*Topology Mirror* tries to address this problem by determining which "
"vertices are mirrored vertices not only by using their positions but also"
" by looking at how those vertices are related to others in the Mesh "
"Geometry. It looks at the overall topology to determine if particular "
"vertices will be treated as mirrored. The effect of this is that mirrored"
" vertices can be non-symmetrical and yet still be treated as mirrored "
"when *X Mirror* and *Topology Mirror* are both active."
