"Shearing is a form of movement where parallel surfaces move past one "
"another. During this transform, movement of the selected elements will "
"occur along the horizontal axis of the current view. The axis location "
"will be defined by the :doc:`Pivot Point "
"</editors/3dview/object/editing/transform/control/pivot_point/index>`. "
"Everything that is \"above\" this axis will move (Shear) in the same "
"direction as your mouse pointer (but always parallel to the horizontal "
"axis). Everything that is \"below\" the horizontal axis will move in the "
"opposite direction."

"Select the elements you want to operate on and activate the *Shear* "

":menuselection:`Object/Mesh/Curve/Surface --> Transform --> Shear` menu "
"option or by pressing :kbd:`Shift-Ctrl-Alt-S`. The amount of movement "
"given to the selection can be determined interactively by moving the "
"mouse or by typing a number. Pressing :kbd:`Enter` will confirm the "
"transformation. The confirmed transformation can be further edited by "
"pressing :kbd:`F6` or by going into the Tool Shelf and altering the "
"Offset slider provided that no other actions take place between the "
"*Shear* transform confirmation and accessing the slider."
