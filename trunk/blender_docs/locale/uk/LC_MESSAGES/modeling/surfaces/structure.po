"Many of the concepts from :doc:`curves </modeling/curves/introduction>`, "

"It is very important to understand the difference between NURBS curves and "
"NURBS surfaces: the first one has one dimension, the latter has two. Blender "
"internally treats NURBS surfaces and NURBS curves completely differently. "
"There are several attributes that separate them but the most important is "
"that a NURBS curve has a single interpolation axis (U) and a NURBS surface "
"has two interpolation axes (U and V)."

"However, you can have \"2D\" surfaces made of curves (using the :doc:"
"`extrusion tools </modeling/curves/properties/geometry>`, or, to a lesser "
"extent, the filling of closed 2D curves). And you can have \"1D\" curves "
"made of surfaces, like a NURBS surface with only one row (either in U or V "
"direction) of control points produces only a curve..."

"Visually you can tell which is which by entering *Edit Mode* and looking at "
"the 3D View header: either the header shows *Surface* or *Curve* as one of "
"the menu choices. Also, you can :doc:`extrude </modeling/curves/properties/"
"geometry>` a whole NURBS surface curve to create a surface, but you cannot "
"with a simple NURBS curve."

"Control points for NURBS surfaces are the same as for NURBS curves. However, "
"their layout is quite constraining. The concept of \"segment\" disappears, "
"replaced by \"rows\" and the overall \"grid\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/surfaces/structure.rst:38
msgid ""
"A \"row\" is a set of control points forming one \"line\" in one "
"interpolation direction (a bit similar to :ref:`edge loops <modeling-mesh-"
"structure-edge-loops>` for meshes). So you have \"U-rows\" and \"V-rows\" in "
"a NURBS surface. The key point is that *all* rows of a given type (U or V) "
"have the *same* number of control points. Each control point belongs to "
"exactly one U-row and one V-row."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/surfaces/structure.rst:44
msgid ""
"All this forms a \"grid\", or \"cage\", the shape of which controls the "
"shape of the NURBS surface. A bit like a :doc:`lattice </rigging/lattice>`..."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/surfaces/structure.rst:47
msgid ""
"This is very important to grasp: you cannot add a single control point to a "
"NURBS surface; you have to add a whole U- or V-row at once (in practice, you "
"will usually use the Extrude tool, or perhaps the Duplicate one, to add "
"those...), containing exactly the same number of points as the others. This "
"also means that you will only be able to \"merge\" different pieces of "
"surfaces if at least one of their rows match together."

"Guess what? Yes, it works exactly like :ref:`NURBS Curves <modeling-curve-"

"curve."

msgid ""
"In Fig. :ref:`fig-surface-intro-weight` a single control point, labeled \"C"
"\", has had its *Weight* set to 5.0 while all others are at their default of "
"1.0. As you can see, that control point *pulls* the surface towards it."

"If all the control points have the same *Weight* then each effectively "
"cancels each other out. It is the difference in the weights that cause the "
"surface to move towards or away from a control point."
msgstr ""

"NURBS can create pure shapes such as circles, cylinders, and spheres (note "
"that a Bézier circle is not a pure circle). To create pure circles, globes, "
"or cylinders, you must set to specific values the weights of the control "
"points. Some of which are provided as presets in the *Curve Tools* panel "
"(lower right corner). This is not intuitive, and you should read more on "
"NURBS before trying this."
msgstr ""

"To create a sphere with 2D surfaces, its the same principle as with a 2D "
"circle. You will note that the four different weights needed for creating a "
"sphere (1.0, 0.707 = sqrt(0.5), 0.354 = sqrt(2)/4, and 0.25)."
