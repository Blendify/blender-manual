"Curves and :doc:`Surfaces </modeling/surfaces/introduction>` are particular "
"types of Blender Objects. They are expressed by mathematical functions "

"Blender offers both :ref:`curve-bezier` and :ref:`curve-nurbs`. Both Bézier "
"curves and NURBS curves and surfaces are defined in terms of a set of "
"\"control points\" (or \"control vertices\") which define a \"control polygon"
"\"."

"Both Bézier and NURBs curves are named after their mathematical definitions, "
"and choosing between them is often more a matter of how they are computed "
"behind the scenes than how they appear from a modeler's perspective. Bézier "
"curves are generally more intuitive because they start and end at the "
"control points that you set, but NURBs curves are more efficient for the "
"computer to calculate when there are many twists and turns in a curve."

"The main advantage to using curves instead of polygonal meshes is that "
"curves are defined by less data and so can produce results using less memory "
"and storage space at modeling time. However, this procedural approach to "
"surfaces can increase demands at render time."

"Certain modeling techniques, such as :doc:`extruding a profile along a path "
"</modeling/curves/properties/geometry>`, are possible only using curves. On "
"the other hand, when using curves, vertex-level control is more difficult "
"and if fine control is necessary, :doc:`mesh editing </modeling/meshes/"
"editing/introduction>` may be a better modeling option."
