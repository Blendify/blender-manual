"World settings enable you to set some basic effects which affect all scenes "
"throughout your game, so giving it a feeling of unity and continuity. These "
"include ambient light, depth effects (mist) and global physics settings. "
"These effects are a limited subset of the more extensive range of effects "
"available with the Blender internal or Cycles renderer."

msgid ""
"While world settings offer a simple way of adding effects to a scene, :doc:"
"`compositing nodes </compositing/index>` are often preferred, though more "
"complex to master, for the additional control and options they offer. For "
"example, filtering the Z value (distance from camera) or normals (direction "
"of surfaces) through compositing nodes can further increase the depth and "
"spacial clarity of a scene."

"Light is calculated with a ray-traced method which is the same as that used "
"by Ambient Occlusion. The difference is that Environment lighting takes into "
"account the \"ambient\" parameter of the material shading settings, which "
"indicates the amount of ambient light/color that that material receives."

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/game_engine/world.rst:67
msgid ""
"Mist can greatly enhance the illusion of depth in your rendering. To create "
"mist, Blender makes objects farther away more transparent (decreasing their "
"Alpha value) so that they mix more of the background color with the object "
"color. With Mist enabled, the further the object is away from the camera the "
"less its alpha value will be. For full details, see :doc:`Mist </render/"
