"A word of warning, before you start any big or serious project with the "
"Blender Game Engine, you should note that it is currently not very supported "
"and that there are plans for its retargeting and refactoring that, in the "
"very least, will break compatibility. For further information, you should "
"get in touch with the developers via mailing list or IRC and read the "
"`development roadmap <https://code.blender.org/2013/06/blender-"
"roadmap-2-7-2-8-and-beyond/>`__."

"Blender has its own built in Game Engine that allows you to create "
"interactive 3D applications or simulations. The major difference between "
"Game Engine and the conventional Blender system is in the rendering process. "
"In the normal Blender engine, images and animations are built off-line -- "
"once rendered they cannot be modified. Conversely, the Blender Game Engine "
"renders scenes continuously in real-time, and incorporates facilities for "
"user interaction during the rendering process."

"By default, the user has access to a powerful, high level, Event Driven :doc:"
"`Logic Editor </editors/logic_editor>` which is comprised of a series of "
"specialized components called \"Logic Bricks\". The :doc:`Logic Editor </"
"editors/logic_editor>` provides deep interaction with the simulation, and "
"its functionality can be extended through Python scripting. It is designed "
"to abstract the complex engine features into a simple user interface, which "
"does not require experience with Programming. An overview of the :doc:`Logic "

"The Game Engine is closely integrated with the existing code base of "
"Blender, which permits quick transitions between the traditional modeling "
"feature set and game-specific functionality provided by the program. In this "
"sense, the Game Engine can be efficiently used in all areas of game design, "
"from prototyping to final release."
