"In the BGE, an object can have different \"states\". At any time while "
"the game is playing, the current state of the object defines its "
"behavior. For instance, a character in your game may have states "
"representing awake, sleeping or dead. At any moment their behavior in "
"response to a loud bang will be dependent on their current state; they "
"may crouch down (awake); wake up (asleep) or do nothing (dead)."

"States are set up and used through controllers: note that only "
"controllers, not actuators and sensors, are directly controlled by the "
"state system. Each object has a number of states (up to 30; default = 1),"
" and can only be in one state at any particular time. A controller must "
"always specify the state for which it will operate -- it will only give "
"an output pulse if a) its logic conditions are met, and b) the object is "
"currently in the specified State. States are set up and edited in the "
"object's Controller settings (for details see below)."

"State settings are automatic in simple games. By default, the number of "
"states for each object is 1, and all controllers are set to use State 1. "
"So, if a game does not need multiple states, everything will work without"
" explicitly setting states -- you do not need to bother about states at "
"all."

"One of the actuators, the State actuator, can set or unset the object's "
"State bits, and so allow the object's reaction to a sensor signal to "
"depend on its current state. So, in the above example, the actor will "
"have a number of controllers connected to the \"loud bang\" sensor, for "
"each of the \"awake\", \"asleep\" or \"dead\" states. These will operate "
"different actuators depending on the current state of the actor, and some"
" of these actuators may switch the actor's state under appropriate "
"conditions."
