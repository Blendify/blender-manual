"Stereo Cameras allow you to generate images that appear three dimensional "
"when wearing special glasses. This is achieved by rendering two separate "
"images from cameras that are a small distance apart from each other, "
"simulating how our own eyes see. When viewing a stereo image, one eye is "
"limited to seeing one of the images, and the other eye sees the second "
"image. Our brain is able to merge these together, making it appear that we "
"are looking at a 3D object rather than a flat image. See `Stereoscopy "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy>`__ for more information on "
"different stereoscopic viewing methods."

"This value is extremely important. It determines how far apart the two image-"
"capturing cameras are, and thus how \"deep\" the scene appears. Too small a "
"value and the image appears flat; too high a value can result in headaches "
"and eye strain. The ideal value mimics the separation of the viewer's two "
"eyes."
