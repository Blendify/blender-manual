"This feature allows artists to visualize their interactive projects within "
"an immersive dome environment. In order to make it an extensible tool, we "
"are supporting Fulldome, Truncated domes (front and rear), Planetariums and "

"The Dome camera uses a multipass texture algorithm as developed by Paul "
"Bourke and was implemented by Dalai Felinto with sponsorship from SAT -- "
"Society for Arts and Technology within the SAT Metalab `immersion research "
"program <http://paulbourke.net/miscellaneous/domemirror/BlenderiDome/>`__, "
"that involves rendering the scene four times and placing the subsequent "
"images onto a mesh designed especially such that the result, when viewed "
"with an orthographic camera, is a fisheye projection."
