"The most advanced type of object in the :doc:`Game Engine "

"the fun experimentation that comes from playing around with the non-BGE "
"Soft Body sims (such as Cloth), you will probably find a frustrating lack"
" of options and exciting results. Do not despair, we are here to help you"
" get some reasonable settings."
