msgid ""
"When creating visual assets it is often desirable to have a high amount of "
"detail in the asset for up close viewing. However, this high amount of "
"detail is wasted if the object is viewed from a distance, and brings down "
"the scene's performance. To solve this, the asset can be swapped out at "
"certain viewing distances. This is commonly referred to as a level of detail "
"system. Each visual step of the asset is known as a level of detail. Levels "
"of detail are most appropriate to use when you have a large scene where "
"certain objects can be viewed both up close and from a distance."

"Level of detail settings can be found in the Object settings when the "
"renderer is set to Blender Game. In the Levels of Detail panel is a button "

"level of detail are displayed in its own box. The exception to this is the "
"base level of detail. This is automatically setup as the current object with "
"a distance setting of 0. To remove a level of detail, click on the X button "

"Searches the scene for specifically named objects and attempts to set them "

"tool, your naming must be consistent, and each level must be prefixed or "
"suffixed with \"lodx\" where x is the level that object is intended for. The "
