"The *Curve Guide* is used to force particles to follow a certain path "
"defined by a :doc:`Curve Object </modeling/curves/index>`. A typical "
"scenario would be to move a red blood cell inside a vein, or to animate "
"the particle flow in a motor. You can also use *Curve Guide* to shape "
"certain hair strands."

"*Curve Guide* s affect all particles on the same layer, independently "
