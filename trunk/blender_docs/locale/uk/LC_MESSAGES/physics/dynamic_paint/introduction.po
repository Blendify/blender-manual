"Dynamic paint is a modifier and physics system that can turn objects into "
"paint canvases and brushes, creating vertex colors, image sequences or "
"displacement. This makes many effects possible like, for example footsteps "
"in the snow, raindrops that make the ground wet, paint that sticks to walls, "
"or objects that gradually freeze."
