"Perform the actual fluid simulation. Blender will continue to work "

"Editor, next to the render pulldown. Pressing :kbd:`Esc` or the \"x\" "
"next to the status bar will abort the simulation. Afterwards two "
"``.bobj.gz`` (one for the *Final* quality, one for the *Preview* "
"quality), plus one ``.bvel.gz`` (for the *Final* quality) will be in the "

"This is similar to the animation output settings, only selecting a file "
"is a bit special: when you select any of the previously generated surface"
" meshes (e.g. ``test1_fluidsurface_final_0132.bobj.gz``), the prefix will"
" be automatically set (``test1_`` in this example). This way the "
"simulation can be done several times with different settings, and allows "
"quick changes between the different sets of surface data."

"If the mesh has modifiers, the rendering settings are used for exporting "
"the mesh to the fluid solver. Depending on the setting, calculation times"
" and memory use might exponentially increase. For example, when using a "
"moving mesh with *Subdivision Surface* as an obstacle, it might help to "
"decrease simulation time by switching it off, or to a low subdivision "
"level. When the setup/rig is correct, you can always increase settings to"
" yield a more realistic result."
