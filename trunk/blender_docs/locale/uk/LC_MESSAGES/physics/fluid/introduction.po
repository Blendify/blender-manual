"Fluid physics are used to simulate physical properties of liquids especially "
"water. While creating a scene in Blender, certain objects can be marked to "
"participate in the fluid simulation. These can include but not limited to, "
"being a fluid or as an obstacle. For a fluid simulation you have to have a "
"domain to define the space that the simulation takes up. In the domain "
"settings you will be able to define the global simulation parameters (such "
"as viscosity and gravity)."
