"Note that the object can have any shape, position or type. Once the "
"particle button is pressed, a particle system with the fluid simulation "
"particles will be created for it at the correct position. When moving the"
" original object, it might be necessary to delete the particle system, "
"disable the fluidsim particles, and enable them again. The fluidsim "
"particles are currently also unaffected by any other particle forces or "
