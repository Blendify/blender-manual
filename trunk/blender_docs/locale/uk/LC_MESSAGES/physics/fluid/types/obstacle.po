"This object will be used as an obstacle in the simulation. As with a fluid "
"object, obstacle objects currently should not intersect. As for fluid "
"objects, the actual mesh geometry is used for obstacles. For objects with a "
"volume, make sure that the normals of the obstacle are calculated correctly, "
"and radiating properly (use the *Flip Normal* button, in *Edit Mode*, *Mesh "
"Tools* panel, in the Tool shelf), particularly when using a spinned "
"container. Applying a :doc:`Subdivision Surface Modifier </modeling/"
"modifiers/generate/subsurf>` before baking the simulation could also be a "
"good idea if the mesh is not animated."
