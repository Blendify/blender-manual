"All regions of this object that are inside the domain bounding box will be "
"used as actual fluid in the simulation. If you place more than one fluid "
"object inside the domain, they should currently not intersect. Also make "
"sure the surface normals are pointing outwards. In contrast to domain "
"objects, the actual mesh geometry is used for fluid objects."

"Blender uses the orientation of the Surface Normals to determine what is "
"\"inside of\" the Fluid object and what is \"outside\". You want all of the "
"normals to face *outside* (in *Edit Mode*, use :kbd:`Ctrl-N` or press :kbd:"
"`Spacebar` and choose :menuselection:`Edit --> Normals --> Calculate "
"Outside`). If the normals face the wrong way, you will be rewarded with a "
"\"gigantic flood of water\" because Blender will think that the volume of "
"the object is outside of its mesh! This applies regardless of the *Volume "
"init* type setting."
