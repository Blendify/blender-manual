"Do not be surprised, but you will get whole bunch of mesh (.bobj.gz) files "
"after a simulation. One set for preview, and another for final. Each set has "
"a ``.gz`` file for each frame of the animation. Each file contains the "
"simulation result -- so you will need them."

msgid ""
"Currently these files will not be automatically deleted, so it is a good "
"idea to e.g. create a dedicated directory to keep simulation results. Doing "
"a fluid simulation is similar to clicking the *animation* button. Currently "
"you have to take care of organizing the fluid surface meshes in some "
"directory by yourself. If you want to stop using the fluid simulation, you "
"can simply delete all the ``*fluid*.bobj.gz`` files."

"Fluid objects must be completely inside the bounding box of the domain "
"object. If not, baking may not work correctly or at all. Fluid and obstacle "
"objects can be meshes with complex geometries. Very thin objects might not "
"appear in the simulation, if the chosen resolution is too coarse to resolve "
"them (increasing it might solve this problem)."

"Do not try to do a complicated scene all at once. Blender has a powerful "

"For example, to produce an animation showing two separate fluid flows while "
"keeping your domain small, render one ``.avi`` using the one flow. Then move "
"the domain and render another ``.avi`` with the other flow using an alpha "
"channel (in a separate B&W .avi?). Then, composite both ``.avi``\\ 's using "
"the compositor's add function. A third ``.avi`` is usually the smoke and "
"mist and it is laid on top of everything as well. Add a rain sheet on top of "
"the mist and spray and you will have quite a storm brewing! And then "
"lightning flashes, trash blowing around, all as separate animations, "
"compositing the total for a truly spectacular result."

"If an object is initialized as *Volume*, it has to be closed and have an "

"Blender freezes after clicking *bake*. Pressing :kbd:`Esc` makes it work "
"again after a while -- this can happen if the resolution is too high and "
"memory is swapped to a drive, making everything horribly slow. Reducing the "
"resolution should help in this case."

"Blender crashes after clicking *bake* -- this can happen if the resolution "
"is really high and more than 2GB are allocated, causing Blender to crash. "
"Reducing the resolution should help in this case. Many operating systems "
"limit the total amount of memory that can be allocated by a *process*, such "
"as Blender, even if the *machine* has more memory installed."

"The meshes should be closed, so if some parts of e.g. a fluid object are not "
"initialized as fluid in the simulation, check that all parts of connected "
"vertices are closed meshes. Unfortunately, the Suzanne (monkey) mesh in "
"Blender is not a closed mesh (the eyes are separate)."

"Note that first frame may well take only a few hundred MBs of RAM memory, "
"but latter ones go over one GB, which may be why your bake fails after "
"awhile. If so, try to bake one frame at the middle or end at full res so you "
"will see if it works."

"Using \"generate particles\" will also add memory requirements, as they "
