"It is generally recommended to bake your physics simulations before "
"rendering. Aside from no longer needing to go through the time-consuming "
"process of simulating again, baking can help prevent potential glitches and "
"ensure that the outcome of the simulation remains exactly the same every "
"time."

"Most physics simulators in Blender use a similar system, but not all have "
"exactly the same settings available. All the settings are covered here, but "
