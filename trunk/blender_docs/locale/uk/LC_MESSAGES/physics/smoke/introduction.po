"Smoke simulation is used to simulate the fluid movement of air and generate "
"animated :term:`voxel` textures representing the density, heat, and velocity "
"of other fluids or suspended particles (i.e. smoke) which can be used for "
"rendering."

"Smoke and fire are emitted into a :doc:`Domain </physics/smoke/types/"
"domain>` from a mesh object or particle system. Smoke movement is controlled "
"by airflow inside the domain, which can be influenced by :doc:`smoke "
"collision objects </physics/smoke/types/collisions>`. Smoke will also be "
"affected by scene gravity and :doc:`force fields </physics/force_fields/"
"index>`. Airflow inside the domain can affect other physics simulations via "
"the smoke flow force field."
