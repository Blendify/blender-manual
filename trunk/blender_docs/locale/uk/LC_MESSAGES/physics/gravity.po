"Gravity is a global setting that is applied to all physics systems in a "
"scene. It can be found in the scene tab. This value is generally fine left "
"at its default, -9.810 on the Z-Axis, which is the force of gravity in the "
"real world. Changing this value would simulate a lower or higher force of "
"gravity. Gravity denoted g, measurement *m* × *s*\\ :sup:`-2`\\)."

"Gravity is practically the same around the entirety of planet *Earth*. For "
"rendering scenes from the *Moon*, use a value six times smaller, e.g. 1.622 "
"*m* × *s*\\ :sup:`-2`\\. The planet *Mars* has a gravity value of 3.69."
