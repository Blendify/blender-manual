"There are two different collision types that you may use: collision "
"between different objects and internal collision. We should set one thing"
" straight from the start: the primary targets of the collision "
"calculation are the vertices of a Soft Body. So if you have too few "
"vertices too few collision takes place. Secondarily, you can use edges "
"and faces to improve the collision calculation."

"A cube colliding with a plane works pretty well Fig. :ref:`fig-softbody-"
"collision-plane1`, but a plane falls right through a cube that it is "
"supposed to collide with Fig. :ref:`fig-softbody-collision-plane2`. Why "
"is that? Because the default method of calculation only checks to see if "
"the four vertices of the plane collides with the cube as the plane is "
"pulled down by gravity. You can activate *CFace* to enable collision "
"between the face of the plane and the object instead Fig. :ref:`fig-"
