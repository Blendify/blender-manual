"To create a connection between the vertices of a Soft Body object there "
"have to be forces that hold the vertices together. These forces are "
"effective along the edges in a mesh, the connections between the "
"vertices. The forces act like a spring. Fig. :ref:`fig-softbody-force-"
"interior-connection` illustrates how a 3Ã—3 grid of vertices (a mesh plane"
" in Blender) are connected in a Soft Body simulation."

"But two vertices could freely rotate if you do not create additional "
"edges between them. Have you ever tried building a storage shelf out of "
"four planks alone? Well, do not do it, it will not be stable. The logical"
" method to keep a body from collapsing would be to create additional "
"edges between the vertices. This works pretty well, but would change your"
" mesh topology drastically."

"Luckily, Blender allows to define additional *virtual* connections. On "

"vertex and any vertices connected to its neighbors *Bending Stiffness*. "
"In other words, the amount of bend that is allowed between a vertex and "
