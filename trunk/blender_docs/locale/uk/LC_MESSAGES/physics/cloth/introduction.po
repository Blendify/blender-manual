"Cloth simulation is one of the hardest aspects of CG, because it is a "
"deceptively simple real-world item that is taken for granted, yet actually "
"has very complex internal and environmental interactions. After years of "
"development, Blender has a very robust cloth simulator that is used to make "
"clothing, flags, banners, and so on. Cloth interacts with and is affected by "
"other moving objects, the wind and other forces, as well as a general "
"aerodynamic model, all of which is under your control."

"A piece of cloth is any mesh, open or enclosed, that has been designated as "
"cloth. The *Cloth* panels are located in the *Physics* tab and consist of "
"three panels of options. Cloth is either an open or closed mesh and is mass-"
"less, in that all cloth is assumed to have the same density, or mass per "
"square unit."

"Cloth is commonly modeled as a mesh grid primitive, or a cube, but can also "
"be, for example, a teddy bear. However, Blender's :doc:`Softbody system </"
"physics/soft_body/index>` provides better simulation of closed meshes; Cloth "
"is a specialized simulation of fabrics."

"Once the object is designated as Cloth, a Cloth :doc:`modifier </modeling/"
"modifiers/index>` will be added to the object's modifier stack "
"automatically. As a :doc:`modifier </modeling/modifiers/index>` then, it can "
"interact with other modifiers, such as *Armature* and *Smooth*. In these "
"cases, the ultimate shape of the mesh is computed in accordance with the "
"order of the modifier stack. For example, you should smooth the cloth "
"*after* the modifier computes the shape of the cloth."

"So you edit the Cloth settings in two places: use the Physics buttons to "
"edit the properties of the cloth and use the Modifier stack to edit the "
"Modifier properties related to display and interaction with other modifiers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can *Apply* the Cloth Modifier to freeze, or lock in, the shape of the "
"mesh at that frame, which removes the modifier. For example, you can drape a "
"flat cloth over a table, let the simulation run, and then apply the "
"modifier. In this sense, you are using the simulator to save yourself a lot "
"of modeling time."

"Results of the simulation are saved in a cache, so that the shape of the "
"mesh, once calculated for a frame in an animation, does not have to be "
"recomputed again. If changes to the simulation are made, you have full "
"control over clearing the cache and re-running the simulation. Running the "
"simulation for the first time is fully automatic and no baking or separate "
"step interrupts the workflow."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/physics/cloth/introduction.rst:63
msgid ""
"Computation of the shape of the cloth at every frame is automatic and done "
"in the background; thus you can continue working while the simulation is "
"computed. However, it is CPU-intensive and depending on the power of your PC "
"and the complexity of the simulation, the amount of CPU needed to compute "
"the mesh varies, as does the lag you might notice."

"If you set up a cloth simulation but Blender has not computed the shapes for "
"the duration of the simulation, and if you jump ahead a lot of frames "
"forward in your animation, the cloth simulator may not be able to compute or "
"show you an accurate mesh shape for that frame, if it has not previously "
"computed the shape for the previous frame(s)."
