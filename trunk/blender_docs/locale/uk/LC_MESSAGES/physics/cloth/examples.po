"To start with cloth, the first thing you need, of course, is some fabric. "
"So, let us delete the default cube and add a plane. In order to get some "
"good floppy and flexible fabric, you will need to subdivide it several "
"times, about eight is a good number. So :kbd:`Tab` into *Edit Mode*, and "
"press :kbd:`W` :menuselection:`Specials --> Subdivide multi`, and set it to "
"8."

"Now, we will make this cloth by going to the Physics tab. Scroll down until "
"you see the *Cloth* panel, and press the *Cloth* button. Now, a lot of "
"settings will appear, most of which we will ignore for now."

"That is all you need to do to set your cloth up for animating, but if you "
"press :kbd:`Alt-A`, your lovely fabric will just drop very un-spectacularly. "
"That is what we will cover in the next two sections about pinning and "
"colliding."

"You can *Apply* the Cloth Modifier at any point to freeze the mesh in "

"Another example of aging is a flag. Define the flag as a simple grid shape "
"and pin the edge against the flagpole. Simulate for 50 frames or so, and the "
"flag will drop to its \"rest\" position. Apply the *Cloth* Modifier. If you "
"want the flag to flap or otherwise move in the scene, re-enable it for the "
"frame range when it is in camera view."

"Now, if you followed this from the previous section, your cloth is probably "
"looking a little blocky. In order to make it look nice and smooth like the "
"picture you need to apply a Smooth and/or Subdivision Surface Modifier in "
"the *Modifiers* tab. Then, in the same editor, find the *Links and "
"Materials* panel (the same one you used for vertex groups) and press *Set "
"Smooth*."
