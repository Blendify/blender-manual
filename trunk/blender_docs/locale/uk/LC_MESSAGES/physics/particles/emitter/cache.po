"*Emitter* systems use a unified system for caching and baking (together "
"with softbody and cloth). The results of the simulation are automatically"
" cached to disk when the animation is played, so that the next time it "
"runs, it can play again quickly by reading in the results from the disk. "
"If you *Bake* the simulation the cache is protected and you will be asked"
" when you are trying to change a setting that will make a recalculating "
"necessary."

"The simulation is only calculated for the positive frames in-between the "
"*Start* and *End* frames of the *Bake* panel, whether you bake or not. So"

"As animation is played, each physics system writes each frame to disk, "

"that the simulation starts."
