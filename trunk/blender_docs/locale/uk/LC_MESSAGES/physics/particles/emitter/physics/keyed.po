"The particle paths of keyed particles are determined from the emitter to "
"another particle system's particles. This allows creation of chains of "
"systems with keyed physics to create long strands or groovy moving "
"particles. Basically the particles have no dynamics but are interpolated "
"from one system to the next at drawtime."

"If you use only one keyed system the particles will travel in their "

"An example: let us assume that you have two keyed systems in a chain and "
"a third system as target. The particle lifetime of the first system shall"
" be 50 keys. The particles will travel in 25 frames from the first keyed "
"system to the second, and in further 25 frames from the second system to "
"the target. If you use the Timed button for the first system, the Time "
"slider appears in the second systems panel. Its default value is 0.5, so "
"the time is equally split between the systems. If you set Time to 1, the "
"movement from the first system to the second will get all the lifetime "
"(the particles will die at the second system)."
