"Also known as \"Forward Euler\". Simplest integrator. Very fast but also "

"more energy over time. For example, bouncing particles will bounce higher"
" and higher each time. Should not be confused with \"Backward Euler\" "

"Also known as \"2nd order Runge-Kutta\". Slower than Euler but much more "

"energy conservative. It should be noted that in example of the bouncing "
"particles, the particles might bounce higher than they started once in a "
"while, but this is not a trend. This integrator is a generally good "
