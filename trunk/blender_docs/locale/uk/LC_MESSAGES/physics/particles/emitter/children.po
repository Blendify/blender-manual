"*Children* are *Hair* and *Keyed* particles assigned subparticles. They "
"make it possible to work primarily with a relatively low amount of Parent"
" particles, for whom the physics are calculated. The children are then "
"aligned to their parents. Without recalculating the physics the number "
"and visualization of the children can be changed."

"Children can be emitted from particles or from faces (with some different"
" options). Emission from *Faces* has some advantages, especially the "
"distribution is more even on each face (which makes it better suitable "
"for fur and the like). However, children from particles follow their "
"parents better, e.g. if you have a softbody animation and do not want the"
" hair to penetrate the emitting mesh. But see also our manual page about "
":doc:`Hair </physics/particles/hair/index>`."
