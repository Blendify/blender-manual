 The *Timeline* is one of an animator's most useful tools as it can give a broad overview of a scene's animation.

+Smoke simulation is a subset of the fluids system, and can be used for simulating collections 
+of airborne solids, liquid particulates and gases, such as those that make up smoke. 
 It simulates the fluid movement of air and generates animated :term:`voxel`
 textures representing the density, heat, and velocity of other fluids or suspended particles
-(i.e. smoke) which can be used for rendering.
