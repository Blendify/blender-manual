concise and up-to-date description of Blender's functioning in the current version.

Complementary projects are:

- `StackExchange (Q&A) <https://blender.stackexchange.com>`__.
- `Blender Cloud <https://cloud.blender.org/>`__.
- `Python API reference <https://www.blender.org/api/blender_python_api_current>`__.

There are also tasks on the `current open tasks <https://developer.blender.org/project/profile/53>`__.
