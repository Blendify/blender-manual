The options to manage files are:

New
   Clears the current scene and loads startup.blend
:doc:`Open </data_system/files/open>`
   Open a blend file
:ref:`Open Recent <other-file-open-options>`
   Displays a list of recently saved .blend files to open
:ref:`Recover last session <other-file-open-options>`
   This will load the quit.blend file Blender automatically saves just before exiting.
   So this option enables you to recover your last work session, e.g. if you closed Blender by accident
:ref:`Recover Auto Save <other-file-open-options>`
   This will open an automatically saved file to recover it.
:doc:`Save </data_system/files/save>`
   Save the current blend file.
:doc:`Save As </data_system/files/save>`
   Opens file browser to specify file name and location of save.
:doc:`Save Copy </data_system/files/save>`
   Saves a copy of the current file.

   Opens the user preferences dialog.

   Saves the current scene and preferences to startup.blend.
:doc:`Load Factory Settings </getting_started/basics/default_scene>`
   Restore the default scene to the factory settings.
:doc:`Link or Append </data_system/linked_libraries>`
   You don't have to load a complete file, you can load in only selected parts from another file if you wish.
:doc:`Import </data_system/files/import>`, (:doc:`COLLADA </data_system/files/import/collada>`)
   Blender can use information stored in a variety of other format files which are created by
   other graphics programs.

   Normally you save your work in a .blend file,
   but you can export some or all of your work to a format that can be processed by other graphics programs.
