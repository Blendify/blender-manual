Blender's flexibility with windows lets you create customized working environments for
different tasks such as modeling, animating, and scripting.
It is often useful to quickly switch between different environments within the same file.

To do each of these major creative steps, Blender has a set of pre-defined *screens*,
that show you the types of windows you need to get the job done quickly and efficiently.
*Screens* are essentially pre-defined window layouts.
If you are having trouble finding a particular screen,
you can use the search function at the bottom of the list (pictured right).

**Default Screens available**

Animation
   Making actors and other objects move about, change shape or color, etc.
Compositing
   Combining different parts of a scene (e.g. background, actors, special effects) and
   filter them (e.g. color correction).
Default
   The default layout used by Blender for new files. Useful for modeling new objects.
Game Logic
   Planning and programming of games within Blender.
Scripting
   Documenting your work and/or writing custom scripts to automate Blender.
UV Editing
   Flattening a projection of an object mesh in 2D to control how a texture maps to the surface.
Video Editing
   Cutting and editing of animation sequences.

Blender sorts these screen layouts for you automatically in alphabetical and/or numerical
order. The list is available in the *Info Window* header that is at the top of the
layout for preset screens. This is often confused for a menu bar by those new to Blender;
however it is simply a window showing only its *header*.

To change to the next alphabetically listed screen press :kbd:`Ctrl-Right`;
to change to the previous screen, press :kbd:`Ctrl-Left`.

   Screen and Scene selectors


By default, each screen layout 'remembers' the last :doc:`scene </getting_started/basics/interface/scenes>`
it was used on. Selecting a different layout will switch to the layout **and** jump to that scene.

All changes to windows, as described in :doc:`Window system </getting_started/basics/interface/window_system>` and
:doc:`Window types </getting_started/basics/interface/window_types>`, are saved within one screen.
If you change your windows in one screen, other screens won't be affected.


Configuring your Screens
========================

Adding a new Screen Type
------------------------

.. |addview-button| image:: /images/Manual-Part-I-Interface-Screens-AddView-Button25.jpg

Click on the "Add" button(|addview-button|) and a new frame layout will be
created based on your current layout.

You might want to give the new screen not only a *name* but also a *number* in front of it
so that you can predictably scroll to it using the arrow keys.
You can rename the layout by :kbd:`LMB` in the field and typing a new name,
or clicking again to position the cursor in the field to edit.
For example you could use the name "6-MyScreen". See *Screen and Scene selectors* above.


Deleting a Screen
-----------------

.. |deleteview-button| image:: /images/Manual-Part-I-Interface-Screens-DeleteView-Button25.jpg

You can delete a screen by using the *Delete datablock* button
(|deleteview-button|). See *Screen and Scene selectors* above.


Rearranging a Screen
--------------------

Use the :doc:`window controls </getting_started/basics/interface/window_system/arranging_frames>`
to move frame borders, split and consolidate windows.
When you have a layout that you like, press :kbd:`Ctrl-U` to update your User defaults.
Be aware that all of the current scenes become part of those defaults,
so consider customizing your layouts with only a single, simple scene.

The properties window has a special option: pressing :kbd:`RMB` on its background will
allow you to arrange its panels horizontally or vertically. Of the two,
vertically-arranged panels have greater support.


Overriding Defaults
-------------------

When you save a .blend file, the screen layouts are also saved in it. When you open a file,
enabling the *Load UI* checkbox in the file browser indicates that Blender should
use the file's screen layouts (overriding your defaults in the process).
Leaving the *Load UI* checkbox disabled tells Blender to use the current layout.


Additional Layouts
------------------

As you become more experienced with Blender, consider adding some other screen layouts to suit
your workflow as this will help increase your productivity. Some examples could include:

   1-Model
      Four 3D windows (top, front, side and perspective), Properties window for Editing
   2-Lighting
      3D windows for moving lights, UV/Image Window for displaying Render Result,
      Properties window for rendering and lamp properties and controls
   3-Material
      Properties window for Material settings, 3D window for selecting objects, Outliner,
      Library script (if used), Node Editor
      (if using :doc:`Node based materials </render/blender_render/materials/nodes>`)
   4-UV Layout
      UV/Image Editor Window, 3D Window for seaming and unwrapping mesh
   5-Painting
      UV/Image Editor for texture painting image,
      3D window for painting directly on object in UV Face Select mode,
      three mini-3D windows down the side that have background
      reference pictures set to full strength, Properties window
   6-Animation
      Graph Editor, 3D Window for posing armature, NLA Window
   7-Node
      Big Node Editor window for noodles, UV/Image window linked to Render Result
   8-Sequence
      Graph Editor, video sequence editor in Image Preview mode,
      video sequence editor in timeline mode, a Timeline window, and the good old Properties window.
   9-Notes/Scripting
      Outliner, Text Editor (Scripts) window


.. note:: Reuse your Layouts

   If you create a new window layout and would like to use it for future .blend files,
   simply save it as the User default by pressing :kbd:`Ctrl-U`
   (don't forget: all screens and scenes themselves will be saved as default too).
