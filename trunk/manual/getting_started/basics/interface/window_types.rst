   The Window Type selection menu.


The *Blender* interface is divided up into many rectangular *Window Frames*.
Each *Window Frame* may contain different types of information,
depending upon the *Window Type*.

Each *Window Frame* operates independently of the others,
and you can have the same *Window Type* in many frames. For example, you may have
several *3D windows* open but each looking at the *Scene* from a different
perspective. You can split and merge and resize *Window Frames* to suit whatever you
are working on. You can also arrange some *Window Frames* to display without a
*Header* to save screen space.
