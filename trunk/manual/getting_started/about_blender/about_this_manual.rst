About this manual
*****************

This manual is written by a world-wide collaboration of volunteers.
It is constantly out of date, thanks to the tireless work of developers working from around the
world on the Blender code-base.

However, it is our goal to provide you with the best possible documentation for this incredible package.

To assist you best, this manual is organized according to the creative process generally followed by 3D artists.
If you read the manual linearly, you will follow a natural, progressive path in learning both Blender
and developing your artistic skills.

- Getting to know Blender (basic UI concepts, navigation...)
- Models
- Animation
- Lighting, shading and rendering
- Post-production/VFX (compositing, motion tracking, video editing)
- Extending Blender (working with the Python API)
  
This manual also includes a :doc:`/glossary/index` page for if/when you you ever get confused with
the endless jargon of computer graphics.
There is also a :doc:`/troubleshooting/index` section to help solve technical issues.


Goals
=====

This manual aims to teach you how to use Blender, not how to be a great artist.
That would require a different kind of study and is not unique to Blender alone,
so it is best left to other sources such as books, courses, videos and good old fashioned trial and error.

This manual is written for a very broad audience,
to answer questions like, :doc:`"How do I rotate the default cube?" </getting_started/basics/transformations/rotate>`
all the way to :doc:`"How does Blender handle color management?" </render/post_process/cm_and_exposure>`.
