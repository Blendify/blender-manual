Getting support: the Blender community
**************************************

Being freely available from the start, even while closed source,
helped considerably in Blender's adoption. A large, stable, and active community of users has gathered
around Blender since 1998. The community showed its support for Blender in 2002 when they helped raise
â‚¬100,000 in seven weeks to enable Blender to go Open Source under the `GNU GPL
<http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html>`__.

The community spans two widely overlapping sites:

----

   :target: http://www.blender.org/foundation

The Development Community, centered around the `Blender Foundation site <http://www.blender.org/foundation>`__.
Here you will find the home of the development projects,
the Functionality and Documentation Boards, the CVS repository with Blender sources,
all documentation sources, and related public discussion forums.
Developers contributing code to Blender itself, Python scripters, documentation writers,
and anyone working for Blender development in general can be found here.

The User Community, centered around the independent `BlenderArtists <http://www.BlenderArtists.org/>`__ site.
Here Blender artists, game-makers and fans gather to show their creations, get feedback,
ask for and offer help to get a better insight into Blender's functionality.
Blender tutorials can be found here as well.

----

These two websites are not the only Blender resources.
The worldwide community has created a large number of independent sites,
in local languages or devoted to specialized topics.
A constantly updated list of Blender resources can be found at the above mentioned sites.

Who uses Blender?
=================

Blender has a wide variety of tools for tasks including modeling, animation, rendering, post-production, and
video editing that make it suitable for almost any sort of media production. People and studios around the world
use it for hobby projects, commercials, feature films, games and other interactive applications like kiosks,
and scientific research.
Check out the `User Stories page <http://www.blender.org/features/user-stories/>`__
on the Blender website for more examples.
