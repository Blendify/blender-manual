Welcome to Blender! The Blender documentation consists of many parts: this user manual,
a reference guide, tutorials, forums, and many other web resources.
The first part of this manual will explain what exactly Blender is, and what it can do.

Blender has a powerful interface, highly optimized for a 3D workflow.
The large number of buttons and menus might be a bit intimidating at first, but don't worry.
After a bit of practice it will become familiar and intuitive.

It is highly recommended you read our section on :doc:`The Interface </getting_started/basics/interface>`
carefully to get familiar with both the interface and with the conventions used in the documentation.


What is Blender?
================

Blender was first conceived in December 1993 and became a usable product in August 1994 as an
integrated application that enables the creation of a diverse range of 2D and 3D content.
Blender provides a broad spectrum of functionality in one package.
Through its open architecture, Blender provides cross-platform interoperability,
extensibility, an incredibly small memory and disk footprint, and a tightly integrated workflow.
Blender is perhaps the most popular open source 3D graphics applications in the world.

Aimed at media professionals and artists world-wide, Blender can be used to create 3D visualizations
and still images, as well as TV and cinema quality content, while the incorporation of a real-time 3D
engine allows for the creation of 3D interactive content for stand-alone playback or video games.

Originally developed by the company 'Not a Number' (NaN),
Blender has continued on as Free Software,
with the source code available under the GNU GPL license.
The Blender Foundation in the Netherlands coordinates its ongoing development.

Between 2008 and 2010, key parts of Blender were re-written to improve its functions,
workflow and interface.
The result of this work produced the version of the software known as Blender 2.5.

Key Features:

- Fully integrated 3D content creation suite, offering a broad range of essential tools, including
  modeling, UV mapping, texturing, rigging and skinning, animation,
  many types of simulations (fluid, rigid bodies, etc),
  scripting, rendering, compositing, VFX, and game creation.
- Cross platform, with an OpenGL GUI that is uniform on all major platforms (and customizable with Python scripts).
- High quality 3D architecture enabling fast and efficient creation work-flow.
- Excellent community support from `forums <http://BlenderArtists.org>`__ and
  `IRC <http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Community:Chat#IRC>`__.
- Small executable size, optionally portable.

You can download the latest version of Blender `here <http://www.blender.org/download/>`__.


Blender is a full-featured tool

Blender makes it possible to perform a wide range of tasks, and it may seem daunting when first
trying to grasp the basics. However, with a bit of motivation and the right learning material,
it is possible to familiarize yourself with Blender after a few hours of practice.
This manual is a good start, though it serves more as a reference.
There are also many online video tutorials (free and paid) from specialized websites, and several
books and training DVDs in the `Blender store <http://www.blender3d.org/e-shop/>`__.

Despite everything Blender can do, it remains a tool. Great artists create masterpieces,
not only by pressing buttons or manipulating brushes, but also by learning and practising subjects
such as human anatomy, composition, lighting, traditional animation, and many other areas. 3D
content creation software have the added technical complexity and jargon associated with the underpinning
technologies. Terms like UV maps, materials, shaders, meshes, and subsurf are the mediums of the
digital artist, and understanding them, even broadly, will help you to use Blender to its best.

So keep reading this manual, learn the great tool that Blender is, keep your mind open to
other artistic and technological areas, and you too can become a great artist.
