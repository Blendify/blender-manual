`Freestyle <http://freestyle.sourceforge.net>`__ is a render engine
for creating Non-Photorealistic Line Drawing images from 3D scenes.
It is designed as a programmable interface to allow maximum control over the style of the final drawing:
the user "programs" how the silhouettes and other feature lines from the 3D model should be turned
into stylized strokes using a set of programmable operators dedicated to style description.
