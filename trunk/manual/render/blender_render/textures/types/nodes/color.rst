Texture Color Nodes
*******************

Mix
===

.. figure:: /images/Doc26-textures-nodes-color-mix.jpg

   mix node


This node mixes a base color or image (threaded to the top socket)
together with a second color or image (bottom socket)
by working on the individual and corresponding pixels in the two images or surfaces.
The way the output image is produced is selected in the drop-down menu. The size
(output resolution) of the image produced by the mix node is the size of the base image.
The alpha and Z channels (for compositing nodes) are mixed as well.

.. seealso::

   :term:`Color Blend Modes` for details on each blending mode.


.. note:: Color Channels

   There are two ways to express the channels that are combined to result in a color: RGB or HSV.
   RGB stands for the Red,Green,Blue pixel format,
   and HSV stands for Hue,Saturation,Value pixel format.


Clamp
   Clamps the result of the mix operation between 0 and 1.
   Some of the mix types can produce reults above 1 even if the inputs are both between 0 and 1, such as Add.

Factor
   The amount of mixing of the bottom socket is selected by the Factor input field (Fac:).
   A factor of zero does not use the bottom socket, whereas a value of 1.0 makes full use.
   In Mix mode, 50:50 (0.50) is an even mix between the two,
   but in Add mode, 0.50 means that only half of the second socket's influence will be applied.


RGB Curves
==========

   RGB Curves node


For each color component channel (RGB) or the composite (C),
this node allows you to define a bezier curve that varies the input (x-axis) to produce an output value (y-axis).
Clicking on one of the *C R G B* components displays the curve for that channel.

Invert
======

.. figure:: /images/Doc26-textures-nodes-color-invert.jpg

   invert node


This node simply inverts the input values and colors.


Hue Saturation Value
====================

.. figure:: /images/Doc26-textures-nodes-color-hsv.jpg
   :width: 300px
   :figwidth: 300px

   Hue Saturation Value node


Use this node to adjust the Hue, Saturation, and Value of an input.


Combine and Separate RGB
========================

.. figure:: /images/Doc26-textures-nodes-color-combineRgb.jpg
   :width: 250px
   :figwidth: 250px

   Combine RGB node


These two nodes allow you to convert between float values and color values.
Colors are composed of 3 or 4 channels; red, green, blue, and sometimes alpha.

With Combine RGB, you can specify the values of each channel,
and the node will combine them into a color value.


.. figure:: /images/Doc26-textures-nodes-color-separateRgb.jpg
   :width: 250px
   :figwidth: 250px

   Separate RGB node


With Separate RGB, you can specify a color value, and get each channel value out of it.
