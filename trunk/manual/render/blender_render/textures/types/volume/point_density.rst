*********************
Point Density Texture
*********************

Point density renders a given point cloud (object vertices or particle system) as a 3D volume,
using a user-defined radius for the points. Internally,
the system uses a BVH data structure for fast range lookups.

The rendered points are spherical by default, with various smooth falloff options,
as well as simple Turbulence options for displacing the result with noise, adding fine detail.
When using Point Density with a particle system,
additional particle info such as particle velocity, age, and speed,
can be visualized using a color/alpha ramp gradient.

Turbulence
----------

Adds directed noise to the density at render time

Influence
   Method for driving added turbulent noise

   Static
      Noise patterns will remain unchanged, faster and suitable for stills.
   Particle Velocity
      Turbulent noise driven by particle velocity.
   Particle Age
      Turbulent noise driven by the particle's age between birth and death.
   Global Time
      Turbulent noise driven by the global current frame.

Noise Basis
   See :doc:`Here </render/blender_render/textures/types/procedural>`

Size
   Scale of the turbulent noise
Depth
   Level of detail in the added turbulent noise
Turbulence Strength
   Strength of the added turbulent noise
