  Post Processed Effects
#########################

There are several effects you can enable in the Render Settings that add visual elements to
rendered images, after the rendering has completed. These are not done in camera,
but rather composited on top of the image.

*Composited* and *Sequence* are discussed in :doc:`Output Options </render/output>`.

*Fields* are discussed in :doc:`Video Output </render/output/video>`.
