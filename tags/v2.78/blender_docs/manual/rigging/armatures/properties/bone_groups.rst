   The Bone Groups panel.


This panel allows the creation, deletion and editing of Bone Groups.

Bone Groups are meant to be used during the rig creation to define and assign a color to a meaningful set of bones.
It is an usual convention to color Left parts of the rig as blue and Right parts as red, although it is not mandatory.
These groups can later be easily accessed with the *Select* and *Deselect* buttons.
The *Assign* and *Remove* buttons serve to add or remove the currently selected bones to the currently selected group.

It is important to note that a bone can only belong to one group.
For bones belonging to multiple for easy selection during animation see instead
`Selection Sets <https://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:2.6/Py/Scripts/Animation/SelectionSets>`__.

.. note::

   This mode is only available in Pose Mode.

.. tip::

   Use the mouse scroll wheel over the color templates to quickly skim through the available colors.
