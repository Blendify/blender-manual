Skeleton
   In this panel you can arrange sets of bones into different layers for easier manipulation.
Display
   This controls the way the bones appear in 3D View.
Bone Groups
   Bone Groups are meant to be used during the rig creation to define and assign a color to a meaningful set of bones.


Pose Library
============
