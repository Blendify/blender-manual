Hiding Bones
============

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Edit and Pose Mode
   | Panel:    :menuselection:`Bone --> Display`


You do not have to use bone layers to show/hide some bones. As with objects,
vertices or control points, you can use :kbd:`H`:

- :kbd:`H` will hide the selected bone(s).
- :kbd:`Shift-H` will hide all bones *but the selected one(s)*.
- :kbd:`Alt-H` will show all hidden bones.

You can also use the *Hide* check button of the
:menuselection:`Bone tab --> Display panel`.

Note that hidden bones are specific to a mode,
i.e. you can hide some bones in *Edit Mode*,
they will still be visible in *Pose Mode*, and vice-versa.
Hidden bone in *Pose Mode* are also invisible in *Object Mode*.
And in *Edit Mode*, the bone to hide must be fully selected,
not just his root or tip.
