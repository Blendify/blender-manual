Areas
*****

The application window is always a rectangle on your desktop.
It is divided up into a number of re-sizable areas.
An area contains the workspace for a particular type of editor,
like a 3D View Editor, or an Outliner.


Arranging
=========

Blender uses a novel screen-splitting approach to arrange areas.
The idea is that you split up that big application window into any number of smaller
(but still rectangular) non-overlapping areas. That way,
each area is always fully visible,
and it is very easy to work in one area and hop over to work in another.


Changing the Size
-----------------

You can resize areas by dragging their borders with :kbd:`LMB`.
Simply move your mouse cursor over the border between two areas,
until it changes to a double-headed arrow, and then click and drag.


Splitting and Joining
---------------------

Area Spit Widget
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the upper right and lower left corners of an area are the area split widgets,
and they look like a little ridged thumb grip. It both splits and combines areas.
When you hover over it, your cursor will change to a cross (âœ›).

:kbd:`LMB` and drag it inward *split* the area.

In order to *join* two areas :kbd:`LMB` click and drag the area splitter outward.
They must be the same dimension (width or height) in the direction you wish to join.
This is so that the combined area space results in a rectangle.

   :width: 250px
   
   The Properties Editor is being merged "over" the Outliner.

The area that will closed gets a dark overlaid with an arrow.
Now you can select the area to be closed by moving the mouse over it.

Let go of the :kbd:`LMB` to merge.
If you press :kbd:`Esc` or  :kbd:`RMB` before releasing the mouse, the operation will be aborted.


Area options
^^^^^^^^^^^^

:kbd:`RMB` on the border opens the *Area Options*.

Split Area
   Shows a line that lets you select the area and position where to split.
   :kbd:`Tab` switches between vertical/horizontal.
Join Area
   Shows the join direction overlay.


Swapping Contents
-----------------

You can swap the contents between two areas with :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB`
on one of the splitters of the initial area, dragging towards the target area,
and releasing the mouse there. The two areas do not need to be side by side,
though they must be inside the same window.


Maximizing
==========

The maximized area fill the whole application window.
It contains the Info Editor and the select area.

You can maximize an area with the
:menuselection:`View --> Toggle Full Screen` menu entry.
To return to normal size,
use again :menuselection:`View --> Toggle Full Screen`.
Or :kbd:`RMB` on the editors header and select *Maximize Area* and
*Tiled Area* to return.
In the Info Editor header the *Back to Previous* button on the right of the menus
also returns to tiled areas.

A quicker way to achieve this is to use the shortcuts: :kbd:`Shift-Spacebar`,
:kbd:`Ctrl-Down` or :kbd:`Ctrl-Up` to toggle between maximized and normal areas.

.. note::

   The area your mouse is currently hovering over is the one that will be maximized using
   the keyboard shortcuts.


Opening New Windows
===================

The new window is a fully functional window, which is part of the same instance of Blender.
This can be useful, i.e. if you have multiple monitors.

A new window can be created from :menuselection:`View --> Duplicate Area into new Window`.

You can also create a new window from an existing area by :kbd:`Shift-LMB`
on the area splitter icon, then drag slightly.

The window can be closed with the OS *Close Window* button.
