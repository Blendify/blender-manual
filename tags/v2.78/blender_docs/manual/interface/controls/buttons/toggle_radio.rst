   Toggle Buttons.


.. Toggle buttons are typically displayed as check boxes.

Clicking this type of button will toggle a state but will not perform any operation.


Toggle Drag
-----------

To change many toggle buttons at once, you can :kbd:`LMB` drag over multiple buttons,
This works for checkboxes, toggles in the Outliner and layer buttons.

.. note::

   For layer buttons (a type of toggle button) it is often useful to hold :kbd:`Shift` at the same time,
   to set or clear many layers at once.


Radio Buttons
=============

   Radio Buttons.


Radio buttons are used to choose from a small selection of "mutually exclusive" options.
Use :kbd:`Ctrl-Wheel`, while hovering with the mouse over it, to cycle between the the options.

.. cycling works also for: number, selects (aka menus)
