Years ago people needed a way to quickly draw on their monitors,
they did this with a tool called a grease pencil.
This is especially helpful for animators who need to add notes directly on their screen.
However, note everyone wants to draw on their monitors.
So a digital version was made, also called a grease pencil.

You can use the Grease Pencil tool to draw freehand sketches and
annotations in most of the :doc:`Editors </editors/index>`.
The sketches that are made are saved with the blend-file so they can be seen at any time,
a disadvantage of the old grease pencil.
However, you can also do much more with the digital grease pencil such as:

- Planning animation poses and motion curves.
- Sketching out model topology.
- As director's tool to review shots.

.. note::

   The *Grease Pencil* can also be used by different tools that allow you
   to draw where the tool is to take effect.

In the next few pages you will learn how to use the different tools such as:
