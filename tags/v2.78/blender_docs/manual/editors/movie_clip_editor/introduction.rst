The Movie Clip Editor has two main purposes, it can be used for for tracking or masking movies.
The default layout looks like the image below.

   Movie Clip Editor interface.

In order to get to either the masking or the tracking tools you must first add a movie file.
There are several ways to to this:

- Use *Open* button from movie editor header.
- Use :menuselection:`Clip --> Open` menu.
- Use :kbd:`Alt-O` shortcut.

Both movie files and image sequences can be used in the clip editor.
If you are using an image sequence there is one limitation on naming of files:
the numbers at the end of the image name should be increasing continuously.
After that you will then be able to choose to options in the drop down menu for what you want to do.


So, when a movie clip is loaded into the clip editor, extra panels are displayed in the interface.
