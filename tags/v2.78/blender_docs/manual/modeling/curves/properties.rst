Curve Properties can be set from the *Object Data*
option in the *Properties Header* (shown below in blue).

Shape
=====

.. figure:: /images/modeling_curves_properties_curves-shape-panel.png

   Curves Shape panel.


2D and 3D Curves
   By default, new curves are set to be 3D, which means that Control Points can be placed anywhere in 3D space.
   Curves can also be set to 2D which constrain the Control Points to the Curve's local XY axis.

.. _curve-resolution:

Resolution
   The *resolution* property defines the number of points that are computed between every pair of Control Points.
   Curves can be made more or less smooth by increasing and decreasing the resolution respectively.
   The *Preview U* setting determines the resolution in the 3D View while the *Render U* setting
   determines the Curve's render resolution. If *Render U* is set to zero (0),
   then the *Preview U* setting is used for both the 3D View and render resolution.

   .. figure:: /images/modeling_curves_shape-resolution.jpg

      Curves with a resolution of 3 (left) and 12 (right).

Twisting
   A 3D Curve has Control Points that are not located on the Curve's local XY plane.
   This gives the Curve a twist which can affect the Curve normals.
   You can alter how the twist of the Curve is calculated by choosing from *Minimum,
   Tangent* and *Z-Up* options from the drop-down menu.

   .. figure:: /images/modeling_curves_shape-twist.jpg

      Curves with a twist of minimum (left) and tangent (right).

Fill
   Fill determines the way a Curve is displayed when it is Beveled (see below for details on Beveling).
   When set to *Half* (the default) the Curve is displayed as half a cylinder.
   
   Fill Deformed
      Fills the curve after applying all modification that might deform the curve (i.e. shape keys and modifiers).

   .. figure:: /images/modeling_curves_shape-fill.jpg

      Curves with a fill of half (left) and full (right).

Path/Curve-Deform
   These options are primarily utilized when using a Curve as a Path or when using the Curve Deform property.
   The *Radius, Stretch* and *Bounds Clamp* options control how Objects use the
   Curve and are dealt with in more detail in the appropriate links below.

Geometry
========

   Curves Geometry panel.


Modification
   Offset
      By default, text Objects are treated as curves.
      The Offset option will alter the space between letters.
   Extrude
      Will extrude the curve along both the positive and negative local Z axes.
Bevel
   Depth
      Changes the size of the bevel.

      .. figure:: /images/modeling_curves_geometry-bevel-depth.png

         A Curve with different Bevel depths applied.

   Resolution
      Alters the smoothness of the bevel.

      .. figure:: /images/modeling_curves_geometry-bevel-resolution.png

         A Curve with different resolutions applied.

Taper Object
   Tapering a Curve causes it to get thinner towards one end.
   You can also alter the proportions of the Taper throughout the tapered object
   by moving/scaling/rotating the Control Points of the Taper Object.
   The Taper Object can only be another Curve.
   Editing the Handles and Control Points of the Taper Object will cause the original Object to change shape.

   .. figure:: /images/modeling_curves_geometry-taper.jpg

      A Curve before (left) and after (right) a Bézier Curve Taper Object was applied.

Bevel Object
   Beveling a Bézier Curve with a Bézier Curve as the Bevel Object generally gives it the appearance of a plane,
   while using a Bézier Circle as the Bevel Object will give it the appearance of a cylinder.
   The Bevel Object can only be another Curve.
   Editing the Handles and Control Points of the Bevel Object will cause the original Object to change shape.
   Given the options available, it is best to experiment and see the results of this operation.

   .. figure:: /images/modeling_curves_geometry-bevel.jpg

      A Curve with the Bevel Object as a Bézier Curve (left) and as a Bézier Circle (right).

Fill Caps
   Seals the ends of a beveled Curve.
Map Taper
   For Curves using a Taper Object and with modifications to the *Start/End Bevel Factor*
   the *Map Taper* option will apply the taper to the beveled part of the Curve (not the whole Curve).

   .. figure:: /images/modeling_curves_geometry-map-taper.jpg

      A Curve without (left) and with (right) Map Taper applied.

Start Bevel Factor and End Bevel Factor
   These options determine where to start the Bevel operation on the Curve being beveled.
   Increasing the *Start Bevel Factor* to 0.5 will start beveling the Curve 50% of the distance from the start
   of the Curve (in effect shortening the Curve).
   Decreasing the *End Bevel Factor* by 0.25 will start beveling the Curve 25% of the distance from the end
   of the Curve (again, shortening the Curve).

   .. figure:: /images/modeling_curves_geometry-bevel-start-end-factor.jpg

      A Curve with no Bevel factor applied (left),
      with a 50% Start Bevel Factor (middle) and with a 25% End Bevel Factor (right).


Path Animation
==============

The *Path Animation* settings can be used to determine how Objects move along a certain path.

Frames
   The number of frames that are needed to traverse the path,
   defining the maximum value for the *Evaluation Time* setting.
Evaluation Time
   Parametric position along the length of the curve that object following it should be at
   (the position is evaluated by by dividing by the *Path Length* value).
Follow
   Make the curve path children rotate along the path.

Active Spline
=============

   Curves Active Spline panel.


The *Active Spline* panel becomes available during *Edit Mode*.

Cyclic
   Closes the Curve.
Resolution
   Alters the smoothness of each segment by changing the number of subdivisions.
Interpolation
   Tilt
      Alters how the tilt of a segment is calculated.
   Radius
      Alters how the radius of a Beveled Curve is calculated.
      The effects are easier to see after Shrinking/Fattening a control point :kbd:`Alt-S`.
   Smooth
      Smooths the normals of the Curve.


NURBS Curves
------------

   NURBS Active Spline panel.

.. _modeling-curve-knot:

Knots
   One of the characteristics of a NURBS object is the *knot vector*. This is a sequence of
   numbers used to determine the influence of the control points on the curve.
   While you cannot edit the knot vectors directly, you can influence them through the
   *Endpoint* and *Bézier* options in the Active Spline panel. Note that the
   *Endpoint* and *Bézier* settings only apply to open NURBS curves.

   Cyclic
      Makes the NURBS curve cyclic.

      .. figure:: /images/modeling_curves_nurbs-cyclic.png

         A NURBS curve with Cyclic applied.

   Bézier
      Makes the NURBS curve act like a Bézier curve.
   Endpoint
      Makes the curve contact the end control points. Cyclic must be disabled for this option to work.

      .. figure:: /images/modeling_curves_nurbs-endpoint.png

         A NURBS curve with Endpoint enabled.

.. _modeling-curve-order:

Order
   The order of the NURBS curve determines the area of influence of the control points over the curve.
   Higher order values means that a single control point has a greater
   influence over a greater relative proportion of the curve.
   The valid range of *Order* values is 2-6 depending on the number of control points present in the curve.

   .. figure:: /images/modeling_curves_nurbs-order.png

      NURBS curves with orders of 2 (left), 4 (middle) and 6 (right).
