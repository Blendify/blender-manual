Lattice Modifier
****************

The Lattice modifier deforms the base object according to the shape of a
:doc:`Lattice </rigging/lattice>` object.
Objects to be deformed can be meshes, curves,
surfaces, text, lattices and even particles.

.. tip::

   A Lattice Modifier can quickly be added to selected objects by selecting them all,
   then selecting the lattice object last and pressing :kbd:`Ctrl-P` and choosing *Lattice Deform*.
   This will both add Lattice modifiers to the selected objects and parent them to the lattice.

   Lattice modifier.

Object
   The :doc:`Lattice </rigging/lattice>` object with which to deform the base object.
Vertex Group
   An optional vertex group name which lets you limit the modifier effect to a part of the base mesh.
Strength
   A factor to control blending between original and deformed vertex positions.


Hints
=====

Why would you use a lattice to deform a mesh instead of deforming the mesh itself in
Edit Mode ? There are a couple of reasons for that:

- If your object has a large number of vertices, it would be difficult to edit portions of it quickly in Edit Mode.
  Using a lattice will allow you to deform large portions efficiently.
- The smooth deformation you get from a lattice modifier can be hard to achieve manually in Edit Mode.
- Multiple objects can use the same lattice, thus allowing you to edit multiple objects at once.
- Like all modifiers, it is non-destructive. Meaning all changes happen on top of the original geometry,
  which you can still go back and edit without affecting the deformation.
- A lattice does not affect the texture coordinates of a mesh's surface.

.. note::

   When using a lattice to deform particles,
   always remember to place the Lattice Modifier after the Particle System Modifier.
