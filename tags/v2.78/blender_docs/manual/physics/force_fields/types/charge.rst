   Charge force field.

A *Charge* force field is similar to spherical field except it changes behavior (attract/repulse)
based on the effected particles charge field (negative/positive),
like real particles with a charge.
This mean this field has only effect on particles that have also a *Charge* field
(else, they have no "charge", and hence are unaffected)!
