   Freestyle core options.


Activating Freestyle in the *Render* tab of the Properties Editor will
give you the following options:

Line Thickness
   There are two different modes for defining the base line thickness:

   Absolute
      The line thickness is given by a user-specified number of pixels. The default value is 1.0.
   Relative
      The unit line thickness is scaled by the proportion of the present vertical image resolution to 480 pixels.
      For instance, the *unit line thickness* is 1.0 with the image height set to 480 px, 1.5 with 720 px
      and 2.0 with 960 px.

Line Thickness
   Only for *Absolute* line thickness: base line thickness in pixels is 1.0 by default.
